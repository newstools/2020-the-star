The Building Bridges Initiative forum that had been scheduled for Makueni on Saturday has been postponed. This is with respect to the death of the country's second President Mzee Moi which happened on Tuesday morning at the Nairobi Hospital. After visiting Mzee Moi's home at the Kabarnet Gardens, Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua said the decision was reached after consulting Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. "We have agreed that we postponed the rally until a later date," Wambua said. He also called upon other leaders to suspend all other political activities across the country until Mzee Moi is laid to rest. Makueni Senator Mtula Kilonzo Junior echoed his remarks saying that the family of the Mzee Moi needs to mourn peacefully without political rallies. Several leaders including President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William RutoRaila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka among others have eulogised Mzee Moi. Uhuru said Moi was passionate Pan-Africanist who not only built his nation but wanted a better continent. "The late Mzee Moi's steady hand guided Kenya through the restoration of multi-partyism and many other challenging periods; culminating in the peaceful transfer of power in December 2002," Uhuru said. Ruto in his address to the nation said the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua will take over all the burial plans for the late retired President. Ruto, who was addressing the media at Harambee House Annex on Tuesday said Uhuru had directed that Kinyua will be in charge of the plans. Ruto said the government will be issuing further communication on the burial date in due time. “As a teacher evangelist who tossed himself into politics, Mzee Moi excelled. His genuine concerns, loyalty, and sincerity allowed him to attain power and attract massive support,” Ruto said. The Deputy President said Kenya will never forget his discipline and dedication to serve the country.
