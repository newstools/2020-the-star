  The Kenya Union of Special Needs Education Teachers has urged members to shun job opportunities that require them to work in Northeastern citing insecurity. KUSET secretary general James Torome on Monday said they were fully backing the Teachers Service Commission for withdrawing teachers working in the region. He cited spates of terror attacks targeted at non-local teachers in Wajir, Garissa and Mandera counties by suspected al Shabaab militants. "Teaching in the region has become very dangerous due to the terror attacks. No teachers should risk their lives until the insecurity situation is resolved," Torome said. He was speaking in Naivasha where he demanded that 30 per cent of employment opportunities be given to their members. He said they have been sidelined for years. He accused TSC giving special needs trained teachers a raw deal, saying for the past five years, only 400 of them have been deployed, with more than 300 others on the waiting list. "It is biased because TSC only prefers teachers already on the payroll and have undergone further training instead of offering jobs to fresh graduates," he said. Member Rosemary Kea asked the government to set up a special kitty for the purchase of bibs and diapers for children with special needs. “We have cases of children suffering from cerebral palsy and they want special care and needs but they have been forgotten by the state,” Kea said. The union's second trustee Charity Kindungwa said they were yet to see a circular, stating that teachers set to undergo further training will be required to pay for their school fees. “We are proposing that the employer pays half of the fees and the teacher the rest so that this programme can be a success,” she said.  edited by peter obuya
