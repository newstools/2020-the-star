Award-winning gospel singer Mbuvi has dropped a new single, #Lulundutu. Directed by GK Macharia, the song talks about how Christ cleanses his disciples' feet in readiness for the Great Commission, cleaning even jiggers. The audio was produced by Ihaji D and Docta Eddie and is done in Kamba, Kikuyu English and Swahili. 'Lulu' and 'Ndutu' mean jiggers in Kamba and Kikuyu respectively. Speaking on the inspiration behind the song, Mbuvi said he composed it intending to win more souls to Christ. The 'Kwata Kawaya' singer is celebrating 20 years in the gospel industry and is keen on supporting upcoming gospel talents through Panache Plume. He is currently working on an album that will feature 20 of his best songs, released and unreleased.
