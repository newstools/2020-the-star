A boy who fled from his Kisii home after scoring 'disappointing' 214 marks in the KCPE exam last year has resurfaced. Ian Mochama, 13, was welcomed with jubilation by family members when he returned home to Mwembe village on the outskirts of Kisii town. Family members said they had a traumatic three months as they searched for the boy. Ian said he vanished after failing to achieve his target of above 370 marks to join a national school. He said he was disappointed when he received a message indicating he had scored 214 marks, and he felt like the world had come to an end. It was then that Ian left Kisii and sought refuge in Nairobi before moving to Mombasa with the help of a friend. The boy says he is now ready to join Form 1 and pursue his dream of becoming a doctor. His mother, Evelyn Nyakerario, said she endured sleepless nights after her son's disappearance. Father Kabila Mochama said they searched for the boy day and night. The search was extended to relativesâ€™ homes and hospitals. Kabila said he would take his son to secondary school so that he could pursue his dreams. His uncle, Samwel Oremo, urged the boy to study hard in school to later help out his parents out of poverty.
