World Under 20 3,000m silver medalist Leonard Bett is hoping to make his debut in the senior ranks when Athletics Kenya select a team to the Africa Cross Country Championships at Uhuru Gardens this weekend. Bett graduated to the senior ranks last year and has made Africa Cross, set for Lome, Togo in April top of the 'to-do' list this year. He will be among a strong team from South Rift at the national cross country championships on Saturday after finishing sixth at the regional trials two weeks ago, in a race won by Julius Tanki. It will, however, be Bett's second international cross country appearance after finishing four in the junior race at the World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark last year. As a 3,000m steeplechase specialist, Bett said he will be using cross country as part of his training for endurance and speed. “I have built a name in steeplechase but I have to compete in cross country as part of my speed work and endurance training as well as gain experience in seniors after graduating. The transition is not easy. It needs a lot of hard work,” said Bett. The 2017 world under 18 2,000m steeplechase gold medalist was a finalist at the World Championships held last year in Doha, Qatar, finishing ninth as compatriot Conseslus Kipruto retained his title. “It was a tough race since I was just making it into the senior level but I thank God I managed to reach the final. Heading into the new season, I want to try my best and register good results,” said Bett. Early this year, Bett defeated homegrown runners to win Iten Premium Cross Country meeting, including fast-rising Haules 10km champion Daniel Simiu.
