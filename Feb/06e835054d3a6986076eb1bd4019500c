HIV prevalence is more than four times higher among uncircumcised men at 10.3 per cent compared to circumcised men at 2.5 per cent. A recent report by the Health ministry shows 91.7 per cent of men aged 15-64 years self-reported to be circumcised. The preliminary results of the Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA) 2018 survey were released by the Ministry of Health in Nairobi on Thursday, after a year-long delay. The report shows among those who tested HIV positive in the survey, 71.1 per cent self-reported being circumcised, while among those who tested negative 91.9 per cent self-reported to be circumcised. Medical male circumcision has been argued to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV heterosexually by almost 66 per cent. "As we move forward towards UHC, our commitment shall be that every Kenyan will get the opportunity to be tested for HIV and that every HIV-positive Kenyan will get access to treatment," Health CS Sicily Kariuki said in a statement. In Kenya medical circumcision is practiced in the majority of counties, with the exception of Turkana, Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Migori. The last four have the highest adult HIV prevalence, with Homa Bay leading with 19.6 per cent. Since 2008, Kenya has provided voluntary medical male circumcision as a component of its HIV prevention programme using a phased approach. The programme initially prioritised VMMC services for men aged 15 years and above, before refocusing to men aged 15-29 years to maximise its public health impact. The report shows five culturally non-circumcising counties reported prevalences ranging from 53.3 per cent to 66.7 per cent. The number of adults living with HIV fell to 1.3 million, the Kenphia report showed.  At least 139,000 children have the virus. Kenphia was conducted between June 2018 and February 2019 and was funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
