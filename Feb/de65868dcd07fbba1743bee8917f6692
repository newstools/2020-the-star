Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku has unveiled a Sh75 million scholarship fund for 430 students in secondary schools and universities. While unveiling the fund in Kajiado town on Thursday, Lenku said the money, which is drawn from the revenue collection, will pay full fees for the 430 students until they complete their education. “This idea came about after we realised that the bursaries we give to students were not enough to cater for the fees for students from poor backgrounds,” Lenku said. After issuing the money to the listed students, Lenku said the same amount will be drawn every year for the same cause. “When I came in as the new governor in 2017, our revenue base stood at about Sh300 million, but we have since passed the Sh1 billion mark,” he said. The governor assured the residents that the scholarships will be issued annually to the needy without prejudice, adding that 250 students from secondary schools and 180 from universities will benefit from the Sh75 million. Students were picked from the county's five subcounties. The county, he said, issues bursaries to more than 9,000 students in secondary schools, colleges and universities. “We raised the amount from Sh80 million last year to Sh150 million this year. We will also make sure that bursaries must be disbursed before the schools open." Kajiado should be at par with other counties in terms of education and appealed to teachers to also do their best to improve national examination results, Lenku said. The event was attended by all the MCAs and senior officers from the county. Edited by R.Wamochie
