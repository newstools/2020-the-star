The MV Jambo developed a mechanical problem on Monday evening as it was carrying vehicles from the mainland to the island. Kenya Ferry Services managing director Bakari Gowa said the vessel developed problems due to high tides and currents. “The engine was overheating because of high currents and tides forcing the coxswain to put off one engine,” Gowa said. He added that two other ferries were nearby to offer support in case of an emergency. According to an advisory from KFS shared earlier on Monday on social media, high tides were to be experienced between 4:58am and 5:18pm on Monday. High tides between 3pm and 3:30pm, according to their advisory, caused the hitch. The tides were expected to reach a height of 3.25m (10.66 ft). After engineers solved the mechanical problems on Monday, the vessel continued on its way. In November last year, the MV Jambo stalled mid-sea causing panic among hundreds of passengers. The ferry which was loaded with passengers and vehicles was headed to the island in the afternoon. In the statement by KFS, MV Kwale rescued the passengers and vehicles aboard the stalled vessel. MV Jambo has a capacity of 1,500 passengers and 150 vehicles and has been operating at Likoni crossing channel since 2017. On February 3, KFS informed commuters that MV Nyayo would be undergoing routine maintenance for two weeks but the ferry has continued to operate without the scheduled maintenance. KFS management had advised commuters to avoid rush hours to avoid inconvenience. In late January, the KFS boss told the Star in an interview that a new ferry would be arriving in the country in February. He said it will help to decongest the crossing channel.
