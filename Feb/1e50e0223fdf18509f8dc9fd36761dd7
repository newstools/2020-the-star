@magatinews  A police officer has shot himself dead at Nyamarambe in Kisii county. County police commander Jebel Munene said Constable Rodgers Arusei shot himself on Tuesday morning at his workstation's reporting desk area. "He shot himself in the chest. We are yet to know the motive," Jebel told the Star. Colleagues at the station said Arusei had reported to work as usual and did not show any signs of stress. "Hardly had he settled when we heard gunshots. We rushed there and found him leaning on the table before he sprawled on the floor with blood oozing from the chest," an officer said. Munene arrived at the scene shortly after. He said they had launched a probe. "He was a young and promising officer and his death has robbed us of him when the country needed him most," Munene said. The officer did not leave a suicide note.  edited by peter obuya
