Tanzanian artiste Mbosso plans to release every two months this year, starting with one before the end of this month and another in April. While speaking to Word Is, Mbosso said he is grateful his songs are hits and are being loved by many. “Almost all of my songs have been well accepted, I thank God, and it has been very big luck of its own,” the artiste said. He mentioned ‘Nipepee’ as being one of his favourite songs, which he likes most. A Kenyan girl called Manira travelled all the way to Tanzania last year just to ask the musician’s hand in marriage. Commenting on the story, Mbosso said he advised the girl to go back home and finish her education. “The girl was not bothering me, she was just trying to express her love to me, but the means she was using to express that love was not good,” he said. Asked about the challenges he faces now that he is singing alone compared to when he was in a band, Mbosso said the difference he sees between when he used to sing with Yamoto band and now is just the fact that then they were four and now he is on his own. “Mbosso is still the same, he is the same musician and what he sings is still the same,” he said. He plans to visit Kenya in early March this year.
