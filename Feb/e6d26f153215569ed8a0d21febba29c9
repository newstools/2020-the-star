ODM party leader Raila Odinga has said he was a victim of one of the late and former President Daniel Moi's mistakes, but decided to forgive and move forward. Speaking during Mzee Moi's funeral service at Nyayo Stadium on Tuesday, Raila said despite being a great leader, he had weaknesses. "He was human and made great contributions, but like many individuals, he had weaknesses and I was one of the victims. But he was forgiving like I am forgiving... We made our peace and we shook hands and worked together to bring this country a new Constitution," Raila said. The crowd cheered at this point. Raila was among politicians who were arrested and detained for organising a political rally without a permit in 1990. Raila took the opportunity to bring up the Building Bridges Initiative and said Kenyans could learn from the way he and Mzee Moi shook hands and agreed to work together for the good of the country. "We as a family convey our condolences and say may the Lord rest his soul in eternal peace," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta arrived at Nyayo Stadium at 10.15am for the funeral service. Mzee Moi's family,Â Heads of State and dignitaries paid tribute to the former president.
