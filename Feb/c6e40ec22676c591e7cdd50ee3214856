'Machete' hitmaker Jose Gatutura has set his sights on becoming a pastor. In a YouTube interview, Jose said he goes to church but rarely performs. "I am not saved but I know Christ is the Lord and I always see that I will one time become a pastor. But at the right time," he said. He says he is sure he can preach and even do better. "I preach through my music, only that most people don't understand the message. There is time for everything and I will be a gospel artiste," he said. Known for outstanding hits like 'Tuirio twega' (Good Food), 'Haha ni gute' (This is vanity) and 'Mwari wa muthamaki' (Daughter of a king), Jose has become a household name in many Kikuyu homes. He says most of his songs are directed by God. He says most of his music addresses the wrongs done in today's society. "I always refer to something that has ever happened to me or I have seen happening to people," he said. "A song like 'haha nigute', I address both men and women, try to stop them from getting love from the wrong places. With that, I save many marriages back home," Jose said. He has also addressed the 'Pride spirit' in one of his songs, 'Dia kihanya' (Greet me). Known for his slogan, 'Machete', Jose says music requires a lot that God guided. "It requires one to be so prayerful because there are many enemies along the way. There are others even praying idol gods for you," he said. The singer has tried to collabo with gospel artistes but they don't take him seriously. "They refused but I can sing with anyone," he said.
