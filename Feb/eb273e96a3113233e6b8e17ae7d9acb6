The Education ministry has been unable to trace 4,811 candidates who sat last year's KCPE exam as it wraps up the secondary transition drive. CS George Magoha on Tuesday said, "We have achieved 99.8 per cent, which in my capacity as a government officer is 100 per cent because the 0.2 per cent is not statistically significant." "By close of business on February 17, the ministry, working jointly with TSC and the Ministry of Interior, where the most important constant is the chief, we have been able to trace all the children that took part in the national examination." Interior CS Fred Matiang'i had given a February deadline for transition. Magoha said some candidates were excluded from the selection process during the data cleaning process, including those who are overage, inmates and refugees in camps. A total of 1,083,456 pupils sat the 2019 KCPE exam. "Out of this process we remained with 1,075, 201 who became eligible for placement. The total unaccounted for as per today is 4,811," Magoha said. The CS said some of the candidates might have left the country or died. He said, "So from our perspective, we have achieved 100 per cent transition. Magoha said Sh8.2 billion will be used to improve infrastructure in schools. The first release of funding by the Treasury is expected to be released on Tuesday, with the remaining amount expected to be released in the next two weeks. "We are also going to lobby CDF and politicians to ensure they allocate a significant amount this year for infrastructure," Magoha said.
