Ongea, the Eastern Africa Music Summit, has invited Empress Rose Green, founder of Intl Starz, to be one of this year’s bookers for its 5th Edition, being held from tomorrow to Sunday at the all-new Sarit Expo Centre in Westlands. This year’s theme is 'Disrupt to Thrive'. Ongea! (and its decade-long predecessor of Kenya Music Week) has been at the forefront in supporting the development of the music industry in Africa, into one that is more professional, transparent and profitable for all. Ongea! 2020 will feature 32 showcases from different artists, given 25 minutes each, over the four days of the summit, from 6-10pm each evening, performing to international and local festival or event bookers or owners and fans. As a lawyer, songwriter, producer and label business executive, Empress Rose Green will select at least one of the showcases to go perform at one of Jamaica’s Music Festivals during 2020, with all expenses covered.
