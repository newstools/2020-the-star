 Nairobi, Kilifi, Turkana and Mandera will receive the lion’s share of the Sh369.8 billion allocated to counties in the 2020-21 budget should Parliament adopt a proposal by the National Treasury. The allocation includes Sh316.5 billion equitable share and Sh53.3 billion advanced to the devolved governments in loans and grants by the Treasury and international donors. While the Treasury has proposed to retain the equitable share, it has slashed the loans and grants by Sh8.6 billion from the 2019-2020 allocation of Sh61.9 billion. The grants include Sh4.32 billion allocated to Level 5 hospitals, Sh300 million for construction of county headquarters, Sh900 million for User Fee Forgone, Sh6.20 billion for serving the Managed Equipment Service Programme, Sh9.43 billion for road maintenance and Sh2 billion for rehabilitation of youth polytechnics. The County Allocation of Revenue Bill, 2020 shows Nairobi county will get Sh15.95 billion in total shareable revenue. Last year, the city county got Sh15.91 billion. The allocation was prepared by the Treasury and tabled in the Senate on Thursday. Kilifi has been allocated Sh10.60 billion compared to Sh10.44 billion it got in 2019-20. Turkana's share has increased by Sh400 million to Sh10.57 billion while Mandera will get Sh10.22 billion. The four counties will get Sh702.89 million, Sh544.00 million, Sh485.43 million and Sh477.24 million respectively in loans and grants. Other top gainers in the proposed allocations are Kiambu (Sh9.84 billion), Nakuru (Sh9.74 billion), Wajir (Sh8.54 billion), Meru (Sh8.10 billion), Kitui (Sh8.86 billion) and Machakos (Sh8.03 billion). Lamu, Tharaka Nithi, Elgeyo Marakwet, Isiolo and Laikipia will receive the least allocations of Sh2.75 billion, Sh3.86 billion, Sh3.86 billion, 4.17 billion and 4.81 billion respectively. Garissa, Bomet, Baringo, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Kajiado will get Sh7.06 billion, Sh5.50 billion, 5.12 billion, Sh6.83 billion and Sh6.39 billion respectively. “The county government’s equitable share of revenue was allocated among the county governments on the second basis of the revenue allocation criteria approved by Parliament,” the bill says. The allocation is based on the individual counties’ geographical size, physical development, population and own-source revenue performance. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani said the slashing of loans and grants was informed by continued underperformance in ordinary revenue. “The proposals contained in the bill take into account the fiscal framework set out in the Budget Policy Statement for 2020-21 and are intended to ensure fiscal sustainability specifically against the backdrop of escalating pressure on the fiscal framework occasioned by the increase in Consolidated Fund Services,” the bill says. The Commission on Revenue Allocation had, however, proposed an allocation of Sh321.74 billion to the counties based on the third allocation formula proposed by the commission. The formula is however yet to be approved by Parliament. Yatani said the allocation represents 26.5 per cent of the most recent audited revenue – way above the minimum threshold of 15 per cent.  edited by peter obuya
