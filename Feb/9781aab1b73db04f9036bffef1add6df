A group of Al shabaab militants have torched an escavator and a lorry belonging to the H-Young company that's currently undertaking the construction of the Lamu-Garsen road on Sunday afternoon. The incident which took place at Milihoi area has been confirmed by Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia. Macharia said four heavily armed Al shabaab militants burned a H-Young excavator and a lorry that was transporting cement near the H-Young camp at Milihoi at around 12.30pm. The driver of the lorry and the excavator controller were however able to escape unhurt. He said a multi-agency security operation has since been launched to pursue the terrorists who are believed to have fled in a forest nearby. Transport on the road was halted for slightly over an hour but has since resumed with a heavy presence of KDF and other security units being witnessed.
