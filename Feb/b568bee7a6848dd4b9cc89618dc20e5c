A nominated Member of County Assembly was yesterday arraigned at a Milimani court for allegedly forging an ODM document. Perpetua Mponjiwa was charged with making a document without authority against the law. The court heard that on July 14, 2017, she without authority made a document, namely, office of the Registrar of Political Parties members’ status certificate, purporting it to be a genuine document issued by the RPP. Mponjiwa was also charged with uttering a false document to High Court judge Grace Nzioka, purporting it to be a genuine status certificate issued by the RPP. The accused person denied the charges and through her lawyer sought to be released on a free bond. She further submitted that her arrest was meant to interfere with a swearing in that had been directed by a court. “The speaker of the county assembly had been directed to swear her in within seven days and this is fashioned to interfere with the swearing in,” the defense said. Appearing before seniuor resident magistrate Nzibe Muthoni, the accused was released on a Sh300,000 cash bail with an alternative of Sh200,000 bond.
