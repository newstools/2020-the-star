A 13-year-old girl has been rescued from early marriage in Lporos village in Samburu Central subcounty. The girl will be taken to a safe place and given a chance to pursue her primary education. She completed Grade Three last year and was married off to a 45-year-old man with whom she lived for one month. The area assistant chief and police officers stormed the house where the girl had been locked up and rescued her. “She had been locked inside a house since December after she was married off. Luckily, she accessed a mobile phone and called me asking for help,” assistant chief Robert Lekasuyian said. He said the girl who was being raised by a single mother was married off by a relative from her family. Samburu Central subcounty police commander Alex Rotich said the suspects including the man who had married the minor and the relative who allegedly married her off are still at large. “We got information through the area chief that there was a man who had married a minor. Police officers accompanied the chief to rescue the girl but everyone including the girl’s relatives and the man who had married her ran away,” he told the Star on phone. Rotich said police have launched investigations in order to arrest suspects and prosecute them. He advised residents against marrying off underage girls and instead give them a chance to access education in primary and secondary schools.
