 A collaboration between Safaricom and  Mowgli has seen 42 ladies undergo a year-long mentorship programme aimed at advancing their career growth. The programme established in 2018 aims at growing the number of women in leadership positions within Safaricom as part of itsWomen in Leadership Initiative. “Our women in leadership program support our goal of achieving diversity in leadership. In addition, it helps enhance capacity building for our women,” Safaricom director for Resources, Paul Kasimu said. Safaricom's percentage of women in senior management roles currently stands at 35 per cent and through the mentorship programme, it seeks to grow this to 40 per cent through creating a platform of talents  to take up leadership roles. Only four in 62 of chief executive officers of companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange are women and only three, or five percent, of these firms have women as chair of their boards of directors, a recent report dubbed accordng to the Gender Equality in the Workplace report by NSE. However, the proportion of women on the boards in Kenya continues to improve – increasing slightly since 2017 and almost doubling since 2012.
