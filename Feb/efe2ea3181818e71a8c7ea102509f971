The mutilated and burnt body of a woman was found by police in Kihoto Estate near Naivasha town. Her eyes had been gouged out; the body was partially burnt. Residents were fearful as police removed the body to the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. Witness Pius Mwangi said the woman had been missing for three days. “Some relatives have been able to identify her from the clothes she was wearing but her body is badly mutilated,” he said. She was not identified. Police are trying to find her husband before making public the name. Meanwhile, the number of people killed by hippos around Lake Naivasha in the last week hit three after a man was crushed to death. The man was attacked by the lone hippo near Karagita landing beach and was pronounced dead on arrival at Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. Two of his colleagues managed to escape as fears rise over an increase in hippo attacks in the lake. Last week, two foot-fishermen were killed by hippos in two separate incidents as cases of human-wildlife conflict escalate. David Kilo from Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association said the crushed man was setting up nets near the shorelines of the lake when the hippo attacked. He attributed the increase in fatal attacks to a rise in the number of foot-fishermen and the wild animals. “In the last year, we have seen an increase in cases of attacks and last week we lost two men to the hippos,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said inquest files had been opened and the bodies collected. The victim has been identified and the relatives informed. Edited by R.Wamochie
