Chemelil head coach Charles Odera has credited the team’s recent resurgence to the financial boost from Muhoroni Youth chairman Moses Adagala Chemelil have had a new lease of  life after the controversial chairman took over the team at the start of the second leg and have for the first time this season gone for three consecutive matches without tasting defeat. The sugar millers registered their second win of the season last weekend beating Posta Rangers 2-1 at the Muhoroni Stadium to move out of the bottom position for the first time this season. The win, which was preceded by a two draws against Western Stima and Sofapaka, saw Chemelil who are walkover away from being axed from the elite league, take their tally to nine points and are now three away from making their way out of the red zone. Adagala took over the reigns last month, beefing up the playing unit with new acquisitions whom Odera says have increased competition. Odera disclosed that through Adagala,the players can afford a smile as meals and logistics are guaranteed as well as their welfare. Besides, Adagala allowed the club to play their home matches at Muhoroni to help them generate income through gate collections which were not coming forth while playing at the Chemelil Stadium, thanks to the open field. “He has helped revive the club which was almost sinking. Before he came on board, players would play on empty stomachs and we were unable to raise money to honour matches. During the first leg, we would concede in the second half as our players would run out of energy but that is a thing of the past,” he said He added: “He has instilled hope in them as he is slowly honouring his promise to hand them allowances from the last three matches. He also brought in new players who have pushed the rest and generally there is fighting spirit in the unit.” Odera in the meantime is keen to steer the team out of the jaws of relegation by picking maximum points in the remaining matches.
