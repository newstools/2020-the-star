Rapper Nyashinki will be a daddy in a few weeks. Sources close to the couple revealed to Word Is that Nyashinski and his Nandi bae, Zipporah ‘Zia’ Bett, are expecting their firstborn child next month. Zia has not posted anything about her pregnancy on social media but was spotted with a baby bump while running errands in one of the busy malls in Nairobi. A source who requested anonymity said, “The couple loves their privacy, that is why they kept the news underwater. They are expecting the child mid-March latest.” Adding, “Nyashinski did not want to he trolled about being unmarried and having a child out of wedlock. After all, his parents are church people, who are respected for the positions they hold in the church.” The two exchanged vows in a traditional ceremony in Nandi county in November. Our sources said Nyashinski is set to release his first album in April.
