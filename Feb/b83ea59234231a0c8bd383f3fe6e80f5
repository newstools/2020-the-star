Kisii School coach Hesbon Chweya said the team is ready for the games, having extended their training into the just-ended mid-term break. "We have trained really well and expect to play well against Kegati,” said Chweya. “We don’t expect a tough game against them. Real competition will be at the county level.” Chweya said their main opponents in 15s rugby at the county level are upcoming Nduru Boys and Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho while in 7s, Nyabigena Boys and Nyamagwa Boys will likely give them a run for their money.
