Vision 2030 can only be achieved if the country has enough technical expertise, Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi said. Speaking in Muhudu, Hamisi subcounty, he said the expertise will come from technical training institutes and Technical and Vocational Education and Training. He urged schools within Vihiga to focus on technical courses, which have been ignored for long. He said the notion that TVETS and TTIs are for failures is wrong. “We need to compete effectively with developed countries globally. We need electricians, plumbers, masons, among other personnel to grow as a nation,”  Oyugi said. He challenged schools to promote and support the development of talent by allowing students to participate in co-curricular activities of their choice citing that it might help them in the future. Meanwhile, county police commander Hassan Barua warned the public against taking the law into their own hands. He said suspects have a constitutional right to be heard in a court of law. “When you arrest a suspect just hand him or her to security agents for interrogations before being taken to court. That way we shall be able to root out more suspects that are hiding among us without our knowledge,” Barua said. This comes after an angry mob on Sunday lynched a suspected motorcycle thief in Shamakhokho Market.
