Mombasa-based actor Dan Sonko has spoken out for the first time after moving on with another woman following his wife’s death. His wife Dru died in 2017, days after giving birth to their secondborn child. Dan is currently dating a fellow actor, Winfred Bwire, who says she was friends with Dan's late wife. Speaking in an interview with Radio Jambo, Bwire said she knew Dan even before he married Dru. "I knew Dan through the acting industry and his wife (Dru) was my friend," she said. She, however, said she did not have a romantic relationship with Dan when his wife was alive. "I don’t think I’ve betrayed her. I never thought he would be my lover at any point in life because he had a family at that time," she said. The father of two also revealed that he took off his wedding ring months after Dru died to mark a new start in life. "It is a relationship that ended. I still have memories of my first wife and sometimes wish she were here to see her kids grow, but I have faith because she did not choose the day to die," he said. Dan says his greatest driving force is the children. "Were it not for them, maybe I would have followed her as well. I want them to grow to the extent they won't feel like they lack the mother's love and would also want them to know the love their mother had for them. She was an angel for them," she said. Dan thanked his mother for helping him raise his children. "I thank my mum because she took a vital role in my kids' lives, especially the young one. My siblings also. The transition was not easy to take up the roles, but the first few months, my mum was there for me," he said. He and Bwire have been dating for five months now and they plan to live together in future. Dan says his biggest challenge is his friends because some are emotionally attached and have not accepted that he should move on.
