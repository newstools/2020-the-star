Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org, has announced a USD 1 million (Sh 100 million) grant to promote safe Internet use by children, young people and families in Africa. The grant will support training by non-profit and social enterprises focusing on privacy, trust and safety in Africa. The programme launches in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa this week. The launch is part of the 16th annual Safer Internet Day celebrations, which was marked on Tuesday globally. Children comprise more than 30 per cent of Internet users. Google Kenya country director Charles Murito said, “We can't do it alone. That's why we are launching a pan-African fund to support innovative project ideas by nonprofits and social enterprises around digital literacy and online safety of children, young people and families.”
