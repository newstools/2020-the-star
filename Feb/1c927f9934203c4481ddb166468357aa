The head of the Anglican Church of Kenya has reiterated that the pulpit should not be misused to sanitise ill-gotten money from politicians. Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit said on Sunday that if someone wants to contribute to the church, he should do so like any other and not announce the worth of the donation. Sapit, who spoke at St Paul's ACK church at Kanamkemer in Lodwar, Turkana, announced:  "The ACK doesn't need harambee in the church. The church depends on the contribution of Christians. If someone wants to contribute to the church it should not be something to be announced and bragged about." The Archbishop, who was on a four-day visit to Turkana, said Jesus taught that the intention is what matters during donations.  The poor widow who gave two small copper coins was more appreciated than the rich people threw in large amounts and bragged about them. Sapit emphasised the importance of church leaders being at the forefront of the fight against corruption. They should refuse donations from corrupt leaders, he said. ODM leader Raila Odinga has been critical of those who donate millions of shillings in church harambees yet they refer themselves as hustlers, a word associated with Deputy President William Ruto. He says some politicians go to churches with sacks of money despite Kenya's economy being on its knees due to corruption. “Some politicians are now bribing church officials to invite them for fundraisers at which they donate more than what they earn. The money is to corrupt society and buy support from people," Raila says. Ruto, on his part, says his faith comes first before 'politician' titles. "Since Sunday school we learned to kneel before and worship God. That's the only reason we stand before men," he says. "We will continue to worship Jehovah with our hearts and substance."
