Two politicians from Eastern have disowned Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, following her move to order the eviction of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria from a BBI rally on Saturday. Senator Enoch Wambua decried the intolerance towards Kuria during the rally. "We leaders from Lower Eastern are disturbed by the intolerance during the BBI rally. Ngilu did not act for Kitui county. Her remarks were personal and she should be held responsible for her actions," he said. "Lower Eastern region is firmly behind BBI. Kitui governor must draw a line between opposition to BBI and a situation where leaders express divergent views." Kuria was ordered out of the rally, shortly after they arrived. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Kuria did not have seats and as arrangements were being made to have them seated, Ngilu ordered Kuria out of the rally. “Nobody will abuse Mheshimiwa Rais na aingie kwa mkutano wangu, hakuna, atolewe, atoke,” the governor said. Wambua said, "This was not part of planning and we condemn it. On behalf of Kitui people, I say pole (sorry) to my colleagues." Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu said, "What happened is very unfortunate, it was not part of the planning. It was an individual's decision. I believe as we move forward, it is important that we accommodate everyone." "Everybody is most welcome to our region and we apologise to Moses Kuria." Kuria, in a Facebook post, said he had forgiven Ngilu following how she treated him. "Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing," he wrote on Facebook.
