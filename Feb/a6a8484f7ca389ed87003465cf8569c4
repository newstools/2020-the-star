The world stands with us on the Handshake, BBI, AU envoy Raila Odinga has said. Raila was speaking when they had a luncheon with President Uhuru Kenyatta in Washington, US alongside other officials. "On a historic day at a historic International Luncheon in Washington, I joined hands with President Uhuru Kenyatta and shared with the world our journey to reconciliation," Raila tweeted. "The world stands with us. We must stand firmly with each other as Kenyans and reconcile our people." Uhuru and Raila attended the 68 US National Breakfast Meeting after an invitation by the US Congress. While speaking at the Atlantic Council forum on Wednesday, Uhuru said Africa’s problem has been ideological extremists opposed to democracy. He urged the US to support Africa's war on terror, adding that Africa has the youngest and fastest-growing population with lots of unexploited agricultural. Trade, security and investments topped the agenda during the discussions between Presidents Uhuru and his host at the White House in Washington DC during the last meeting. The two leaders agreed to bolster the Kenya-US partnership in peace initiatives particularly in the Horn of Africa region. US President Donald Trump will later on Thursday host Uhuru at the White House. A statement from the White House Press Secretary on Wednesday said the two leaders will discuss the new opportunities to advance cooperation and trade between the two countries. It will be the second time Trump hosting Uhuru at the White House. In 2018, the two leaders met and established the United States-Kenya Bilateral Strategic Dialogue.
