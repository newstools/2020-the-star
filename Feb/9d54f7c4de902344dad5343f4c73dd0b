Despite losing crucial points against Wazito FC at home at Bukhungu Stadium last weekend,  Kakamega Homeboyz have vowed not to relent in the fight for the Kenya Premier League title. Homeboyz's head coach Nicholas Muyoti said they have what it takes to compete for the league title and that remains their focus despite the draw. “Against Wazito, we should have won the match easily if it were not for the questionable decisions by the match officials that  went against us. It was unbelievable to see our opponents being awarded a soft penalty in added time," he said.  “For Kenyan soccer to grow, we need to have competent and disciplined match official, who will be fair to all teams. "It takes heavy investment, sacrifice and hard work to prepare a team for a single match and for the match officials to come and decide which team should win is quite unfair. Muyoti said they want to forget about what happened on Sunday very fast and focus on their next match to avoid being distracted by what he termed as little side shows. He lauded his debutants, saying he was impressed with their performance. I am quite impressed with  especially left back Vincent Mahiga whom we  signed from Chemelil and striker Justus Anene who has been plying his trade outside the country,” said Muyoti. The former AFC Leopards' coach also urged his players to focus on their crucial away  fixtures including Bandari in Mombasa.  Kakamega Homeboyz are currently second on the log  with 40 points from 19 matches—four points adrift  Gor Mahia who have a game in hand.
