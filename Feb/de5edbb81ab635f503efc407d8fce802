Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga today signed condolence book for President Daniel arap Moi at the AU Complex in Addis Ababa. "Looking forward to joining fellow citizens In mourning the former president back home in Nairobi and Kabarak," he tweeted. Retired President Mwai Kibaki on Sunday entered Parliament buildings secretly to view the body of predecessor Daniel Moi. The retired President made his way through Parliament main gate avoiding the gate facing KICC which dignitaries have been using since Saturday morning. Kibaki arrived around 11.10 am. Minutes before his arrival, security ordered everyone from the area to leave. Only top military officers and his handlers were left to usher him in. Not even media including Moi owned Standard media group were allowed to take photos of the former President. Members of the public who had lined up to pay last respect were also stopped briefly for Kibaki to pay his last respects. He left Parliament building at exactly 11.45 am. It is not clear why the arrival of the retired President was treated with such level of secrecy.
