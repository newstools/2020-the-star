 The number of learners at Kizingitini Polytechnic in Lamu East is running low due to, among others, the wrangling among residents over drug trafficking. County commissioner Irungu Macharia on Monday said the situation was worrying and called on elders, religious leaders and activists to assist in reconciling the communities for development, peace and stability. Villages like Kizingitini, Myabogi and Tchundwa in Lamu East have been locked in  decade-long rows over illicit drug business. These occasionally result in violence as machete-wielding gangs attack each other at the slightest provocation. “These gangs walk around freely and are always armed. For instance, two men from Kizingitini and Myabogi disagree and fight. This is escalated to villages where the combatants come from and more bloodshed,” elder Shamsa Omar said. Prospective students do not enrol and attend classes at the institution for fear of attack by vengeful groups. The situation is so bad that villagers prefer hanging out only in their villages and only interact with their rivals when it’s absolutely necessary like during weddings and funerals. Police have warned those causing unnecessary unrest that they will be dealt with mercilessly. Macharia said they will continue meeting community leaders to establish the underlying reasons for tension and misunderstanding. “During our recent visit to Kizingitini Polytechnic, we were shocked to learn that the community differences were so bad that the institution was running out of learners. Locals said it was all due to insecurity. The government won’t take this lightly,” the administrator said. Residents have called for the establishment of more police posts in the villages. “Mbwajumwali village for instance which was renowned for criminal gangs, drugs and murders is now peaceful owing to a new police post in the village. Let’s have the same measures taken for all these other villages,” Kizingitini elder Omar Kassim said. Edited by R.Wamochie
