Mombasa Sports Club captain Mariano Emadau has challenged his teammates to live up to the demands of the Premier League if they are to maintain their top-flight status. The coastal side were the dark horses in the promotion race last season and sealed their return after finishing second behind Parkroad. MSC last played in the top tier in 2016. MSC have intensified their preparations ahead of the new season later this month and have their work cut as they seek to prove a point. The midfielder said even though the Fredrick Arika-tutored side can withstand pressure, he wants the team to be fearless and cautious in equal measure. He said players can draw inspiration from their previous performance where they prevailed against more fancied teams. "We have to be organised because we will be competing in the toughest league. We all need to fight for a common goal as a team. To be the best, you need to be competitive and we have to be ready for the challenge," he noted. Emadau said defensive solidity is necessary and remained optimistic that the new players will be pivotal for the team to achieve their target. Emadau was instrumental for MSC in the final determining match, scored a goal   assisted another in their 3-0 demolition of Kisumu Youngsters to qualify courtesy of a superior goal difference.
