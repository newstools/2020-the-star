Chief magistrate Francis Andayi has recused himself from Embakasi East MP Babu Owino's attempted murder case. While citing the reason for his decision, Andayi indicated that the Director of Public Prosecution had written a complaint on his bail ruling to the Judicial Service Review. Andayi referred the matter to magistrate Bernard Ochoi who will now take up the case. The matter will be mentioned on March 2, 2020. The MP was granted by a Milimani court Sh10 million bail to secure his freedom. He was also ordered to keep off alcohol and narcotic drug in a public establishment during the tenure of the case. The deposited bail will be used to settle Felix Odhiambo, well known as DJ Evolve's hospital bill. The MP was charged with the attempted murder of DJ Evolve at B-club on January 17. He was also charged with behaving disorderly while carrying a firearm.
