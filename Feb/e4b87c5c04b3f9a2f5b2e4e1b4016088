The locust menace is indeed hurting the country’s food security gains and threatens more damage. The Ministry of Agriculture should rope in all experts including Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi. Mulomi is the immediate former Managing Director of the International Red Locust Control Organisation for Central and Southern Africa (IRLCO-CSA). Over the years, he led the war against locust invasions in the entire Central and South African region–Zambia, Malawi, South Africa and Angola. They have practical know-how and can give some useful input.  Alan Masakhalia Via E-Mail
