The postponement of the   Kenya Women's Premier League by another week has attracted mixed feelings among the stakeholders. The WPL was set to kick off this weekend at various grounds across the country but Football Kenya Federation (FKF) made changes on Tuesday evening, pushing it to the following weekend. The 2019 season ended in November and teams have been training during the off-season that has lasted for three months. Wadadia's coach Rashid Sumba said his new players feel disheartened and face an anxious wait to make their debuts. The Mumias-based side were set to face off with Eldoret Falcons at the Mumias Complex. "The four players we have signed were craving to show me how prepared they are and the information doesn't bode well for them. All the same, we will use the extended period to bond the team through training," he said. Alex Alumira, who tutors defending champions Vihiga Queens, is unmoved by the development, saying his team is ready to take to the field whatever the time. "We have nothing to lose. As for us, we are ready to play anytime. The extended period gives us the chance to play at least two friendly matches."
