A judge has suspended the ministry decision to close land registries in Nairobi for three weeks to conduct an audit. High court judge Weldon Korir allowed an application by the Law Society of Kenya that the move by Lands CS Farida Karoney will expose landowners to fraud. LSK also said the ministry did not consult the stakeholders and members of the public before reaching its decision to close the registries. The Lands ministry had placed an advertisement in the newspapers indicating that the Nairobi central registry will be closed from February 24 to March 13. Aggrieved by the decision LSK filed a suit, saying the closure will affect land transactions. For example, the society said, some documents which have already been assessed by the collector of stamp duty might attract penalties due to delay in payment occasioned by the closure of the registry. There is also a possibility of loss or even misplacement of records during the audit process, the lobby said. According to LSK, the closure will also affect operations at the companies’ registry especially where documents have to be franked before lodging them for registration. The court heard that given the fact that land issues are emotive, stakeholder consultation ought to have been done before reaching the decision. “Furthermore such decisions should have regard to the need for the efficient delivery of service to the public,” LSK said. The society had petitioned the National Assembly on January 21 to investigate the massive failure of the land management system. And now it is accusing Karoney and her PS of failing to follow proper procedure for the approval of the land registration regulations. If allowed to implement the closure of the registry, LSK says, that the CS will be acting prematurely without the necessary legal and regulatory framework. She will also be acting without subjecting the process to public participation as mandatorily required by law.
