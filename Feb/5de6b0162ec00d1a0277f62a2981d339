Nairobi is set to host the first Decentralized Finance Conference in Africa next month. Dubbed DeFi Africa 2020, the event will feature leaders in the Fintech industry who will share their visions of the industry while providing essential insights on current and future trends. The conference aims to position Africa strategically as a destination for innovation, collaboration and investment for digital transformation. Technology is changing fast, along with the capabilities it offers to reinvent traditional cost bases, value propositions, services, and customer engagement. Meanwhile, compliance, regulation, legacy infrastructure, and risk mitigation limit how, and how fast, those technologies are applied. Globally 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone. Digital platforms, including those using blockchain technology, are a critical tool toward promoting inclusion by eliminating barriers for people to access financial services. As Africaâ€™s banking industry rapidly evolves into a largely digitized space, its markets are ready to take advantage of new industrial revolution technologies. With the Fintech industry on a growth trajectory in the whole world, the Summit will explore inclusive solutions through lively debate and thought-provoking case studies.
