After an impressive run which saw them beat National Super League leaders Nairobi City Stars 3-1 last weekend, Coast Stima are now targeting a top-four finish in the second-tier competition. Coach Paul Ogai yesterday said: “We want to play in the play-offs. That is our target.” “However, we must improve our performances on the road. Beating the leaders 3-1 in Nairobi was not a fluke. We worked hard for it and I thank God for the victory,” said the KNVB-trained coach. Ogai praised his new signings, goalkeeper Brandon Obiero, central defenders Idd Haasan (on loan from Bandari) and Omar Mwandaru from Shabana as well as left-back Mongai Atiriza from Kibera Black Stars. “They have increased competition in the team which is good for us. Our training sessions are so competitive because the players want to be in the starting 11,” Ogai noted. “Brandon has conceded just once in the two games he has played. Hassan has played three games and I can tell you he is top technically. With the new players, we believe we can achieve our target because they injected fresh impetus.” The team is not participating in the Betway Shield Cup this weekend and will, therefore, resume action on February 23 against Murang'a Seal at St Sebastian Park in Murang'a County. “We hope to continue with the same form, push ourselves and see what happens,” said Ogai after yesterday's morning training session. The power men are fifth on the log with 39 points, 16 points behind City Stars.
