Yesterday President Daniel arap Moi was remembered in a national funeral service at Nyayo Stadium after lying in state at Parliament. As a former head of state, he deserved this formal send-off. Yet this is also a good time for us to reflect on the fleeting nature of power. Thirty years ago, President Moi seemed all-powerful. He towered over Kenya and dominated all walks of life. Yet all things pass. In 2002 he left office, graciously it must be noted, and now, as we all will, he has left this earth. All leaders should remember that they will not always be in power. Governors, ministers and presidents across the world too often confuse the trappings of power with their own personal worth. Often that makes them reluctant to leave office because they think they are more special than they actually are. So as we mourn and say farewell to Daniel arap Moi, let us remind ourselves that none of us will be here forever. All of us should wield whatever small power we possess in such a way that we are remembered as we would wish. Quote of the day: "We must all obey the great law of change.
