Kabarnet OCPD Francis Gachoki has said a viral video of two uniformed officers captured assaulting a taxi driver is distorted. "I saw the video and I say the information is totally distorte," he said on Friday. The video showed the officers beating the driver along Kabarnet- Marigat-Nakuru highway at police check point located next to Kapropita Primary school. Witnesses who posted the video alleged the taxi driver refused to give a bribe. Gachoki, however, said the driver had a case to answer for flouting traffic rules by loading and carrying passengers unlawfully. "Last week on February 6, our officers on duty stopped him but he refused to stop and instead sped off. Officers marked the vehicle registration number," he said. The police boss said officers spotted him again on Friday, but the driver was 'arrogant' and "even attempted to knock the officers with the car". Gachoki further said when the police officers took the car key, the man alighted and started to fight them. "The man overpowered our officers who were then unarmed and he snatched a police stick from one of them" he said. He said the man had a spare key so he started his car again and sped off. However, residents say the officer had been harassing drivers and demandingÂ  bribes.
