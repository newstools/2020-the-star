Muslim leaders in Kenya on Saturday supported the move by the government of Saudia Arabia to temporarily halt the entry of pilgrims to Mecca as a precaution to curb the spread of coronavirus. The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) in a statement said the decision was "necessary to avert further infections". "SUPKEM welcomes the painful but necessary decision so far taken by the government of the Kingdom of Saudia Arabia to suspend the issuance of travel visas to Muslim faithful across the world who had intended to perform the umrah in the near future," the statement reads. The letter was signed by SUPKEM acting chairman Hassan ole Naado. The Saudi government on Thursday announced it would suspend visas for Muslims seeking to visit Mecca and Medina. Saudi Arabia also suspended visas for tourists from countries with confirmed cases of the virus. Millions of Muslims make the journey each year, especially during the month of Ramadan, which starts in April. Saudi Arabia has, however, not recorded any cases of coronavirus. It is not clear when the visa restrictions will be lifted or how Ramadan and the major Hajj pilgrimage - which begins in July - will be affected.
