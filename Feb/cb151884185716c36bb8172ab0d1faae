Deputy President William Ruto and AU envoy Raila Odinga are among leaders who on Monday condoled with the families who lost their loved ones in the Kakamega Primary School tragedy. The tragedy claimed the lives of 14 pupils, with at least 39 others injured. Ruto said the government has activated its emergency networks and medical specialists to attend to the affected. He said in a tweet: "We are devastated by the tragedy that has hit Kakamega Primary School this evening; our prayers, love and thoughts to the families and relatives of the victims of the misfortune." "We guarantee our total support to ensure the affected learners receive utmost medical attention." Raila called for an immediate probe into the incident. "My heartfelt condolences to parents that have lost loved ones in the unfortunate and regrettable tragedy at Kakamega Primary School. I wish a quick recovery to the injured children and pray that God grant strength to the affected families." Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka said sent his condolences as well and wished the injured students a quick recovery. During the stampede, pupils reportedly started running out of the classrooms after a bell rung to go home. Some pupils said a teacher, who was behind the pupils, ordered them to leave quickly and they started running down the stairs. The pupils in front stumbled and fell and those behind also tripped. The staircase is narrow. Parents wailed as information about the deaths trickled in from the casualty department. Some of the pupils injured sustained fractures and soft tissue injuries while others suffered trauma. Kakamega County Referral Hospital has made an appeal for blood donations.
