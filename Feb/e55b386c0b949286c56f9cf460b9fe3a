The first and longest serving mayor of Thika, Douglas Kariuki Mundia, is dead. Family members confirmed that Mundia who has been ailing for a long time died on Thursday night aged 95. Various leaders led by Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina and ex-councillors forum Kiambu county chairman Ng'ang'a Wanjukira in separate condolence messages described the fallen former mayor as a legendary leader during his time. Wainaina said Mundia had contributed a lot towards making Thika an industrial hub and maintaining cleanliness. "The former mayor was also a champion of social justice and at one time prevented the grabbing of Kiandutu settlement scheme by powerful people. As a result, his private school in the town was closed but he did not budge," the MP said. Wanjukira who is a former civic leader in the defunct municipal council termed Mundia as one of the most effective leaders of his time. "Currently, Thika town is in a deplorable state compared to the days it was a municipality. We are appealing to Governor James Nyoro to return the town to its past glory and ensure the legacy of Mundia does not fade away," Wanjukira said. Nominated MCA John Njiru who also served as a councillor in the municipal council said it was during Mundia's tenure that Thika retained an unbeaten national record as the cleanest town in Kenya for three consecutive years, among other achievements. Former Mayor John Mutahi said Mundia was "a pillar and a giant in civic leadership" and that his administration planned the town properly and ensured all money collected was well utilized. Mundia was elected the first mayor of Thika in 1968 when it was declared a municipality and served in that capacity for more than 20 years. He left office in 1992 after quitting the then ruling party Kanu to join the opposition.
