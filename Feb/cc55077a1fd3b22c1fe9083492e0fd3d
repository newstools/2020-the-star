New swarms of locusts have infested Igoji, Abogeta East and Mitunguu areas in South Imenti, Meru County, leaving a trail of destruction. Area residents and MP Kathuri Murungi have called on for quick spraying of the pests. He said the invasion is about five kilometers stretch. Residents expressed fear of famine and pleaded with Agriculture CS Peter Munya to immediately spray the pests. Kathuri pleaded with county and Agriculture ministry to develop plans to fight the insects. “The government should up their game on how to control multiplication of the insects. Enough chemicals ought to be deployed in all the affected counties. President Uhuru Kenyatta should get correct and accurate information as it is on ground. If drastic measures are not taken then, we might lose the war,” Kathuri said. Mitunguu Ward MCA Mawira Kaaria said the area is the food basket of Meru. He urged the county to compensate affected farmers. Meru Agriculture Chief Officer Martin Munene said the county and national government were doing a surveillance and monitoring of the insects' movement for spraying. The residents have urged the Ministry of Agriculture to tell them the most effective chemical to kill the insects. They have turned to beating iron sheets and drums, whistling and screaming to scare them. Patrick Kiriinya said: “The desert locusts are breeding at an alarming rates and they may lead to a permanent environmental change in the affected areas and reduce soil fertility. CS Munya should come to our rescue by spraying the insects."
