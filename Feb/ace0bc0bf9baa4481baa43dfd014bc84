Strathmore University Gladiators have been challenged to improve on their win ratio in order to have a more efficient season. The students won only five matches in the entire season last year.Â  Talismanic captain Festus Onyango left for Butali and the team faces a herculean task to improve on their last season's eighth-place finish. The team's rebuilding has seen coach Meshack Senge bring on board goalkeepers Emmanuel Sifuna and Newton Kenyatta. Oscar Otieno and Geofrey Owino will anchor the midfield while Brian Gitau will be a lynchpin in a leaky defence that only kept two clean sheets and shipped in 44 goals in 18 matches. Forward Logan Mabuka will at least try to fill in the vloid left by Onyango though Senge insisted that he won't put pressure on his players. "Our win ratio has to improve. We are working on goal scoring and the way we want to play this season should facilitate that. Goal scoring was our biggest undoing last season even as we manipulated play. It was a bad year for us due to inexperience but now the players know what they want," observed the former Kenya International. The national team coach conceded that Onyango;s exit was a big boss for the students but revealed that he is working overtime to plug in the gap.
