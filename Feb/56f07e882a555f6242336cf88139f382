Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana on Tuesday eulogised former President Moi as a nationalist, patriot unlike other African leaders. The retired president died at 5:20am at Nairobi Hospital. In his condolence message, Kibwana said Moi was a true patriot who loved his country and allowed democratic space and growth of youth into leadership during his 24-year tenure. Kibwana was among vocal activists calling for constitutional amendments to allow Kenya to be a multi-party state during Moi’s rule.  Moi wanted a one-party state. The governor said Moi accommodated the views of others even when he disagreed. “He allowed Kenyans to begin the process of amending the Constitution that yielded to the 2010 document,” the county chief said. Unlike other African leaders who hold on to power, Kibwana said, Moi handed over leadership peacefully to President Mwai Kibaki after his preferred candidate Uhuru Kenyatta was defeated in 2002 General Election. The governor also said Moi initiated the development and expansion of the education system in Kenya, which he said nurtured many young people who are now leaders worldwide. He cited the universities and other educational institutions that were established as part of the effort by Moi to expand the education system. Kibwana also said Moi would be remembered for his love of peace and being a staunch Christian. “He never missed the church service unless he was unwell. May his soul rest in peace,” the governor said.
