Turkana legislators have asked the government to deploy more security officers to Kapedo to improve security. Turkana East MP Ali Lokiru, his Turkana North counterpart Joseph Nakuleu and Turkana Woman Representative Joyce Emanikor said continuous bandit attacks have killed many people and destroyed properties. Two weeks ago three people were killed and 14 others injured at Lomelo after bandits attacked their vehicle that was traveling to Kapedo from a construction site. The dead were a police officer and two civilians. MP Lokiru called upon the government to deploy more security officers in the area to avert more killings. They should conduct patrols to reduce cattle rustling, he said. He said when the government asked residents to voluntarily surrender illegal firearms, those in Turkana did but not residents of Tiaty in Baringo county. MP Nakuleu blamed the insecurity in Kapedo on politicians from neighbouring Baringo county. "Why should the government disarm Turkana and leave Pokot who attack our people day a after day?" Woman Rep Emanikor said. She said residents of Baringo county, Laikipia, Samburu and West Pokot were crying over bandits from Tiaty killing innocent people.
