Kisii residents have been told to brace for heavy rains from March to May. Kisii County Director of Meteorology Henry Sese said on Thursday the heavy downpour will most likely cause havoc because it will be accompanied by strong winds and thunderstorms. “Strong winds are likely to be experienced along with showers and thunderstorms in the entire county. Residents are advised to carry out their activities with caution during the period,” Sese told the press in his office. "People should not shelter under trees when it starts raining to avoid being struck by lightning.” Sese noted that some residents endanger their lives by ignoring warnings of floods and lightning and carry on with their daily businesses. He further urged farmers to consult agricultural officers for advice on the kind of farming they should undertake. “Residents should also be told to plant indigenous trees to reduce soil erosion and increase forest cover,” Sese said. The director further urged the county government to open up drainage systems to minimise surface water run-offs and flash floods in many parts. “Surface water run-offs and flash floods will be experienced in many parts of the county that is why I'm advising the devolved unit to open up drainage systems to avert danger," he further said.
