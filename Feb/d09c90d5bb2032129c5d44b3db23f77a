The ability to have different options in attack is the reason why Vihiga Queens opted to sign young forwards ahead of the new season. The three-time Women Premier League champions have signed  Sumeiyah Hamisi, Joan Nabyrie and Bridget Muhonja, who coach Alex Alumira believes will offer the attacking prowess. Hamisi, 16, is a Form One student at Madira Girls. Ugandan import Nabyrie is only 18 while Muhonja is a former Mudavadi Girls' player. The trio are part of the Vihiga Queens rebuilding process as they seek to win their fourth successive title. Alumira said the team's depth at the back was the reason why they concentrated on 'easy to coach' upcoming attacking players. "I have always had a passion to work with young players. They are coachable and easy to integrate into any system. We want to try and have variations upfront in terms of personnel, style of play as well as the attacking formula," the coach said. He revealed: "We won't change so much but there will be a slight twist in the team. We have depth at the back and for the past four seasons, the team has had the meanest defence." The new players will make their debuts in the season opener against Trans Nzoia Falcons this weekend.
