Retired boxer Benson Gicharu has offered words of encouragement to the national boxing team ahead of the start of the African Olympic qualification tournament in Dakar, Senegal on Friday. Gicharu, one of the three fighters who represented  Kenya at the Rio Olympics alongside current Hit Squad member Rayton Okwiri in 2016 but has since hung up his gloves, urged the 13 male and female fighters to always be prepared when they take to the ring. “I’d like to encourage you to be in the right frame of mind, always be prepared,” he added. “The first thing you should do is turn off the doubt button in your mind. Do not doubt whether you are fit enough or not. Put it in mind that you have all it takes to make it to the Tokyo Olympics Games. Also don’t think about the outcome of your games before your bout or what Kenyans or the coaches might say if you lose. As we all know confidence is 60 per cent victory and one should not work under pressure,” advised the 35-year-old former bantamweight pugilist. Gicharu further warned the boxers against judging themselves or their opponent according to previous performance. He said: “Whether it’s a failure or a win; brush it off like nothing happened, keeping in mind that this is a new beginning of writing your own story.” The last batch of the fighters including Okiwiri and the assistant captain and London 2012 Olympian Elizabeth Andiego left the country yesterday morning to link up with their compatriots who had departed earlier on Sunday. Others who left the country on Monday included featherweight Beatrice Akoth, welter Elizabeth Akinyi, lightweight Evelyne Akinyi and light-heavy Humphrey Ochieng.
