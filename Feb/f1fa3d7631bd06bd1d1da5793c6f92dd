Tanasha Donna has begged her baby daddy Diamond Platnumz to stick with her in her new song featuring him. In 'Gere' (Jealous), Tanasha salaciously begs the bongo star not to cheat on her with other girls. Tanasha sings in part, "Don’t you ever leave me solo or disappoint me with these basic hoes." Adding, "You make my mind go lokoloko. Utwapa misemo wa nokonoko. And you better tell them that you are mine. And better be my ride or die." This is not the first time Tanasha is talking to her baby daddy about cheating. Last year, while singing along to American rapper Boogie with da Hoodie’s song, said she loves her baby daddy. However, if he cheats, she won’t touch him, adding that he knows it all too well. “And yeah I love my baby daddy but if he f**k another b***h, I won’t ever touch him (he knows it),” Tanasha captioned the video. When rumours of Diamond cheating on her come out, Tanasha has always defended him.
