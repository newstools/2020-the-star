Two magistrates have disqualified themselves from hearing the divorce case between Meru Senator Mithika Linturi and ex-spouse Marianne Kitany. Yesterday, senior principal magistrate D.W. Mburu, who was allocated the file after magistrate Peter Gesora was transferred, said he could not handle the matter because of personal reasons. He referred the case back to chief magistrate L.L.Gicheha. Last week, Gicheha had directed the parties to appear before Mburu on Monday for further direction, including new hearing dates. However, he recused himself and when the parties went back to Gicheha, she also disqualified herself saying she had handled a case of one of the two parties and would not hear the divorce case. Advocate Muthomi Thiankolu for Linturi told the court that before Gesora was transferred, they had scheduled the hearing for February 13, 24, 25 and 26 and March 10, 11 and 12. He pleaded with the court to expedite the case, saying its pendency is causing his client harm because of the interim orders that had been issued to Kitany. Thiankolu requested the court to direct both parties to stick to the timeframes earlier issue so the case can be fast-tracked. He said the matter has been in court for more than one year and has yet to be concluded even though the High Court ordered it be concluded expeditiously. Kitanny’s lawyer Dastan Omari, for his part, insisted that they were seeking court directions before they raise any matter. But Gicheha said the proceedings had been typed and referred them to senior principal magistrate Grace Mmasi. Mmasi said she needed to peruse the file before giving directions next Monday.
