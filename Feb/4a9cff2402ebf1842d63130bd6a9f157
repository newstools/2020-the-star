The former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka has described the late president Daniel Moi as a humble leader. Kalonzo said during the change of guard in 2002, Moi was mistreated but was able to endure without any drama from him. "As a human being Mzee was very humble but as a leader, he was very firm and this is what people confuse that Moi was Africa's strongman," Kalonzo said. "He handed over power to former President Mwai Kibaki. I remember Mzee Museveni was very angry with the way we treated Mzee Moi at Uhuru Park in 2002." The Wiper leader said the regional organisations were spearheaded by Moi, including finding peace in Sudan during his time. He spoke on Thursday when he went to condole with Moi's family at his residential home in Kabarnet Gardens, Nairobi. The planning committee behind Mzee Moi's state funeral being led by the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said he will be laid to rest on February 12 at his home in Kabarak. The memorial service will be held at Nyayo Stadium. The government has also announced Tuesday a public Holiday for all Kenyans to pay their last respects to Mzee Moi.
