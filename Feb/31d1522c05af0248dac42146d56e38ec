Schools nationwide experience a gap in how they conduct discipline, order and moral values because life skills lessons have not been given much thought. It’s true that unrest in schools is caused by various factors of gap knowledge which would otherwise be avoided only if life skills is given space in our institutions. There is a better solution to resolve conflicts in schools which can only occur through the introduction of life skills as a compulsory subject. University students struggle with issues they wouldn’t experience had they been given better life training in lower levels of education. Most end up in depression, out of school, in drugs or committing suicide. Stakeholders should push for extensive coverage of the subject to prepare youths for inevitable problems of life.  Maseno
