Sauti Sol's Bien says Crystal Asige, one of Sol Generation's signees, is no longer working with them. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Bien said there were disputes that led to their separation. "The dispute was amicably solved and we are glad we worked together for the one year and at least people know Crystal now," he said. Crystal was signed under Sol Generation last year as the only female artiste alongside BenSoul, Kaskazini (a Kenyan urban-fusion trio formed by Chris, Ywaya and Israel) and Nviiri. Bien then said they are looking for proper artistes and not replacements. "I think she got a platform where she can grow," he said. Crystal was featured in one of their songs, 'Extravaganza', a song in Kiswahili with a touch of Rhumba.
