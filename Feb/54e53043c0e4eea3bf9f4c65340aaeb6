Tanasha Donna says Diamond has not left her. This is after Diamond flew back to his country and ended up missing her EP launch last week. On Wilkin's Podcast, Tanasha said, "It was a little bit of an emergency that I don’t want to discuss here. He wouldn’t have wasted his time coming to Nairobi if his intent was not to attend the event.” That same weekend, rumours began to swirl that Diamond was spotted cruising around Dar Es Salaam with Hamisa Mobetto, his ex and baby mama. Responding to these claims, Tanasa said, “Everything is fine between us and we are about to release our music video from the EP, it’s gonna be big.” Diamond has put out a public announcement about a new track he is releasing. It is called, 'Nitakukera Zaidi'.
