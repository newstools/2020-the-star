The University of Embu and the county government are in court over the ownership of land belonging to the over 30-year-old agricultural training centre. The county has moved to court to protect the land on which the Agricultural Training Centre, which is under its agriculture aepartment, stands. This was after the university allegedly blocked access of members of staff to the training centre adjacent to the university. The agriculture department had sued the university before principal magistrate Henry Nyakwemba seeking the court to compel the university to surrender the 20 acres it is claiming. It alleges the university irregularly acquired a title deed. The training centre has lecture halls, hostels, demonstration plots and livestock which the county says have existed for decades before the university. Through a sworn affidavit by chief officer Alvin Mugendi, the county says the university had accepted–through formal application agreement–to have the 20 acres hived off to enable the centre to continue with its activities. But the university, in a sworn affidavit by vice chancellor Daniel Mugendi disputes the claim adding that there was no such agreement with the governor. He said the training centre is within the premises of the university and that it has the sole prerogative to set claim of the anything within its premises. The university stated that the department had been seeking an extension of time to stay as they prepare to move to other areas 'only for them to rush to court to demand the land to be hived off'. The institution said it stands on land that was used by the Commission of Higher Education to grant the charter to the university. The magistrate has urged the two parties to resort to Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanism. The court directed the two parties to file further submission and ordered the status quos to continue until the matter is heard and determined. The parties will fix a hearing date at the registry.
