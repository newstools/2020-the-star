Two drivers were on Friday morning arrested while transporting sand in Voi, Taita Taveta county. The duo had harvested the sand in Voi River despite a sand harvesting ban in the region. Governor Granton Samboja banned sand harvesting and motor and brick-making last year following flooding along the river that displaced more than 200 families. Confirming the arrest, Finance CEC Andrew Kubo said the accused shall be arraigned. They are being held at Voi police station while the two lorries are been held at Voi subcounty offices. "The thriving illegal business is being marshaled by few individuals who have turned to unorthodox ways to beat the ban," Kubo said. He said the unscrupulous businessmen not only caused massive environmental degradation but also denied the county government revenue. Kubo said the finance department has rolled out plans to have a policy framework enacted to regulate sand harvesting. "We want the business to be done in a more organised manner that will assist the county government to realise and strengthen its own source of revenue." Businesspeople engaged in the business have also asked the government to speed up arrangements to lift the ban. Governor Samboja directed the Enforcement Directorate to be moved to the finance department in a bid to strengthen enforcement in revenue collection and improve enforcement of county by-laws.
