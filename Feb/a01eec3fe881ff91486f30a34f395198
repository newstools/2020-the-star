AFC Leopards' head coach Anthony Kimani is working round the clock to turn round the team’s fortunes. Coach Kimani said he is more focused on beefing up the team with youthful players. Speaking in Mumboha playground in Vihiga after edging out Lwanda Villa 1-0 in build-up match, Kimani promised to give the youth opportunities. Ingwe face Chemelil in Kericho in their next KPL fixture. "We have spotted a lot of talent in this region and we want to capitalise on the situation. We need players who are passionate about the sport and ready to sacrifice for the badge of the team," he added. "Generally, the crop of the players we have roped in from little-known grassroots clubs have so far impressed beyond expectations of many. "Leopards need to go back to where they belong;  we are a big team and we feel we have what it takes to restore the lost glory," he added. "The players need to maintain discipline and work hard for the team for us to achieve our objective. "I am impressed with the attitude, fighting spirit and character in the playing unit," said Kimani. Former Mathare and Leopards player reiterated his vision of working with institutions and other local clubs from the region and other parts.
