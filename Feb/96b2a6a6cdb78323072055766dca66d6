Chief Justice David Maraga on Friday led the Judiciary in condoling with the family of the late President Daniel Moi. Maraga was accompanied by his deputy Philomena Mwilu and other officials as they visited Mzee Moi's family at Kabarnet Gardens, Nairobi. The CJ said the death of Mzee Moi is a big loss to different classes of people, including the church. He comforted Baringo senator Gideon Moi, who received them. Maraga recounted his own grief following the death of his mother. "There is no good time that a parent can go. I lost my mother at about a hundred... we can imagine your feelings and we have come as the Judiciary family to say sorry for what has happened and the loss is to all of us," Maraga said. Mzee Moi died on Monday at 5.20am at the Nairobi Hospital. He died at the age of 95 years, but his former press secretary Lee Njiru said that he might be more than 100 years. Njiru said that the late Mzee Moi had informed him several times that he should not rely on the age quoted in his ID. Mzee Moi, who served as the second President of Kenya for 24 years will be interred on Wednesday next week at his home in Kabarak, Nakuru country. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said on Friday while inspecting the preparations for the burial at Kabarak that the government will set up four screens in different towns to project the burial ceremony. Matiang'i said one will be set at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru town, one in Sacho town in Baringo, another one in Kabarnet town and another place which will be agreed upon by the family. Head Public Servant Joseph Kinyua had earlier said that Mzee Moi's body will be leaving Lee Funeral home for Parliament on Saturday. Members of the public will have a chance to view the body.
