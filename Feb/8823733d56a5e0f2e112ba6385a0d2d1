A case in which Kitui Water and Sanitation Company MD Geoffrey Kitonga is charged with assaulting a medic will be heard on March 18. Kitui  senior principal magistrate Margret Kasera  said  the case would proceed  despite the complainant, John Mutua,  a clinical officer  at Kauwi Level 4  Hospital in Kitui West saying on Wednesday he was willing  to withdraw the matter. Kitonga is charged that on October 18 at Ricks Bar and Restaurant in Kitui town he assaulted the medic, causing him bodily harm. He is represented by lawyer Nzuki Mwinzi. On Wednesday, Mutua told the court he was assaulted by the accused who threatened to kill him. He said he was willing to withdraw the case but had not reconciled with the accused. Kitui county principal state  counsel  Bonny Okemwa said that owing to the remarks made by the complainant, Mutua was attempting  to arm-twist the court through doublespeak. Kasera then directed that the case proceed to hearing on March 18. The accused is out on Sh50,000 bond with one surety of a similar amount.
