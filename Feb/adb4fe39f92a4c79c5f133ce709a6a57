The Jubilee Party has fallen short of convening a Parliamentary Group meeting on Friday next week. In a statement on Friday, Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju said the consultative meeting will not technically be a Parliamentary Group. "The consultative meeting will not be technically a Parliamentary Group (PG) meeting, because it will not be chaired by the Party Leader, but it will be an occasion to have a discourse with members and to give an update on various issues of interest and concern in the party." Tuju said President Uhuru Kenyatta had agreed the meeting can take place at the Kenya School of Government at 8.30am. The meeting is likely to be chaired by Deputy President William Ruto. Among the issues to be discussed are the unity of the party, upcoming Jubilee Party elections and BBI politics. The meeting comes after a disgruntled camp of Jubilee politicians who are reportedly tired of waiting for Uhuru to convene a parliamentary group meeting decided to do it themselves. The politicians, largely allied to Ruto's wing of the divided Jubilee Party, held the meeting on January 26 in Naivasha. Uhuru and Ruto met on Monday at State House, Nairobi. It is understood they had lunch together and proceeded for a meeting that ended at 5pm.
