Good evening, Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju has been flown to the UK for specialised treatment following an accident last week, while MCAs have given 10 reasons they want Governor Mike Sonko out. Meanwhile, Maasai leaders have demanded cash to attend the BBI rally set for Saturday. These are the stories making headlines on the Star this evening. Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju has been flown to the UK for specialised treatment following orders by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Tuju, a close ally of the President, was involved in a grisly road accident last Wednesday at Kijabe Hospital while enroute to Kabarak for the burial of the late President Daniel Moi. Nairobi MCAs on Thursday tabled a notice of motion to impeach Governor Mike Sonko. A total of 62 MCAs appended their signature to the motion.   A section of members of the Maasai community have threatened not to attend the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) rally in Narok on Saturday. They have complained over what they termed a skewed selection of delegates for a consultative meeting onÂ Friday.  US ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter was on Thursday stuck in an elevator, moments before he was about to deliver a speech on HIV. "Believe it or not I got stuck in an elevator just before giving a speech announcing good news of HIV success in Kenya," he said.  The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has sent a warning to the Building Bridges Initiative rally organisers. NCIC chairperson Samuel Kobia said on Thursday said people entrusted with organising the delegate forums and rallies as well as speakers must safeguard the integrity of BBI.
