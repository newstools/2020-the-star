It’s all systems go as Ruiru Sports Club prepares to host the 2020 Captain’s Prize this Saturday. Traditionally held in March, the Captain’s Prize has attracted close to 300 players including guest golfers, sponsors and club members. The Saturday event has attracted nearly 10 top pros who will be playing for prize money among them the county’s top pro-Simon Ngige. The event is a befitting farewell party for Peter Mwaura, who served as the golf captain in 2018 and 2019 and vice-captain in 2017. In the run-up to the big occasion, the club has organised a number of events to add the much-needed zest to the occasion. The caddies invitational set the ball rolling on Monday, preceding the curtain-raiser tournament which will take place on Friday. The event is being sponsored by KCB Bank Kenya. “We believe sports sponsorships is a key avenue towards reaching out to our stakeholders and giving back to the communities where we operate,” KCB Marketing and communications director Angela Mwirigi said in a statement.
