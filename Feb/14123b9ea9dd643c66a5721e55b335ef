Deputy President William Ruto has revealed how his graduation was delayed by almost a decade when he became part of the Youth for Kanu (YK92) movement. "I was a first year Masters student at UoN. Because of joining Youth for Kanu, my graduation was delayed by almost 10 years. My studies were put on hold..." he said. Ruto spoke during an interview with Citizen which aired on Thursday. Youth for Kanu was a lobby whose aim was to mobilise support for then President Daniel Moi. Ruto said heÂ was an executive officer, meeting youths from around the country. "We had the big boys - the Jirongo, Muia Waiyaki, Sam Nyamweya, June Moi...," he said. Ruto spoke about the evolution of his relationship with Moi. He said Moi became his mentor over the years.
