The 2020 edition of the Standard Chartered Bank scheduled for March 14  has attracted 40 teams. The seven-a-side football tournament will be staged at St Mary’s School and the draw will be held on March 12. Standard Chartered bank head of sustainability and community engagement Susan Njoroge, says they expect a bigger and more competitive event as teams battle for the sole ticket to represent Kenya in Anfield, Liverpool. “We are happy to be the sponsors of the global event for the last six years and we’ll continue our partnership with our clients through such sporting activities,”.  said Njoroge. While media teams and Stan Chart clients will fight for the sole ticket to represent Kenya at the global event, the bank’s staff will also have their inter-department tournament on the same day, with the winners also heading to Anfield for a four-day fully paid up trip.
