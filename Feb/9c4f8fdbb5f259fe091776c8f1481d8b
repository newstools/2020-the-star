All is set for the Mt Kenya region Building Bridges Initiative rally after ODM leader Raila Odinga met the region's leaders. The governors drawn from counties in the region met with Raila at his office in Capitol Hill, Nairobi to brief him on the arrangements ahead of the February 29 rally. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia said the rally will focusÂ on the economic issues as well as political. "BBI is not about creating posts. It is about uniting this country, improving our security and improving prosperity for our children," Kimemia said. Kimemia said about 30,000 people are expected to attend the rally which will be held at the Kinoru Stadium and that the region is united. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said the rally will be a mega rally from the previous ones. He said there will be no chaos in the rally since the resolutions will originate from the locals. Kiraitu urged BBI opposers to keep away from the rally. "If you think that BBI is a waste of time, please stay at home. Keep away and do not come to Kinoru stadium," Kiraitu said. The rally had initially been scheduled for February 14 but was postponed after the death of former president Daniel Moi. All the BBI rallies were stopped to until Mzee Moi's burial.
