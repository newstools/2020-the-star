Rajab Nyambura has replaced Jane Ndenga in the women's national wheelchair basketball team set to represent Kenya at the Africa Tokyo Paralympic Games qualifiers from March 4 -14 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Ndenga, of classification 1.5, opted out of the team to prepare for wheelchair tennis Paralympic Games qualification. The team features four international players and eight newcomers. The newcomers are Joyce Ambasa (1.5), Mary Zakayo (3.5), Nyambura (1.5), Teresia Wanjiku (1.0), Jennifer Kamande (2.5), Stellar Cherop (2.5), Esther Asega (4.5) and Beth Wanja (4.0). Regulars include assistant captain Eunice Otieno (2.5), Rachel Akoth (2.5), captain Carolyne Wanjira (2.5) and Elizabeth Atieno (4.0). Head coach Andrew Kihumba said his charges are well prepared for the task ahead. “There is a tremendous improvement in the team and I'm positive our results from Johannesburg will be impressive. Players are upbeat and focused to garner a ticket to the 2020 Paralympic Games,” said Kihumba who will be assisted by Caleb Henry Odiyo. In 2017 during the Africa Wheelchair Basketball Championships in Morocco Kenya placed last in the tournament that attracted six countries. Algeria won the tournament beating South Africa and Angola to the second and third places respectively. Egypt was fourth and Zimbabwe fifth. However, as opposed to hurriedly assembling a team for the Morocco assignment three years ago by former Kenya Defence Forces, basketball ace Ancette Wafula, the side has had close to eight months' training. The team has been training at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium twice a week with each session lasting four hours. The lineup made huge strides in December, which enabled them to win the Africa Zone V in Nairobi. “That win was a big morale booster for the girls and we have been polishing up on their strengths and correcting areas we felt we fell short. We are ready to conquer the continent,” added the tactician.
