It will take the government three years to have all police officers in the new blue uniform. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho and Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai said the government is keen to phasing off the old uniform but that would take longer due to the huge number of officers involved. The IG said the number of officers currently stands at 64,000 and the earliest all police officers can have the new uniform is 2023. "The uniform will not be in two sets. In three years we shall have standardised them," Kibicho said. "The numbers are big for the National Police Service, having them in new uniform is a process which will take time." The two were speaking on Tuesday when they appeared before the National Assembly's Public Accounts Committee. President Uhuru Kenyatta unveiled the new uniforms for police officers in 2018 saying it will enhance visibility of the officers. Last year, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said the government is saving over Sh700m in the making of police uniforms locally. The CS said sewing the uniforms locally was a way to support Kenya's economy and create employment.
