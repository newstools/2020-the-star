Homa Bay fishermen yesterday urged the government to take action against people who encroach on riparian lands to end human-wildlife conflicts. Homa Bay BMU chairman Edward Oremo said many business premises have been set up along the lake, inhibiting wild animals from accessing their grazing areas. “Crocodiles, alligators and hippos can’t bask in the sun freely nowadays because the space is no more. Humans have taken riparian lands for private use,” Oremo told journalists in Homa Bay town. He cited restaurants, hotels and resorts.
