Bar and night club operators near learning institutions in Taita Taveta county have been ordered to close down their businesses or relocate to more than 300 metres from the institutions. Governor Granton Samboja issued the directive on Monday, noting that all the licenses shall be revoked until the owners comply with the new regulations. He spoke during the inauguration of the county Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing Board at the county headquarters in Mwatate. The county boss said he won't spare traders selling liquor to children in schools. “These vendors have found a new market in school and that tells you why they are setting up liquor businesses around colleges and technical institutions. We shall not relent on the crackdown to bring sanity,” Samboja said. Samboja cautioned rogue liquor enforcement officers who collude with bar owners to deny the county government of revenue that they will be apprehended. He directed the new board to ensure the malpractice is eradicated and those responsible prosecuted. Samboja said some youths in the county have been rendered useless due to the abuse of illicit liquor. “As you may be aware, our county is still faced with the challenge of illicit brews that have affected many youths and by extension families. As a board, you have the mandate to ensure that you enforce the law in licensing, controlling and enforcing the ban on the consumption of narcotics and any other outlawed substances in the county,” he said The governor revealed that that he had written to the Kenya Bureau of Standards requesting the authority to inspect alcoholic products circulating in the county. Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui urged the new liquor board to help curtail unscrupulous bar operators who are suspected of selling substandard drinks. “This is your time to bring sanity in the cartel-dominated sector. Help the government propel its development agenda by having a sober community,” she said.
