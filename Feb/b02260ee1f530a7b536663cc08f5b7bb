Kenya is currently facing rapid deterioration of living conditions in the slum areas with nearly half of unemployed people in urban areas resorting to crime, a report has shown. A report by UN-Habitat shows 48 per cent of 5.2 million unemployed people in the country are resorting to crime to make ends meet, in a tough economic environment. According to the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census (KPHC), youth unemployment in Kenya stands at 39 per cent, with 5.2 million people aged between 18 and 34 years out of work. Urbanization is one of the global megatrends, which are unstoppable and irreversible, highlighting the need for more sustainable urban planning and public services. “Thirty years from now, around 2.5 billion more people who are two-thirds of the world’s population will be living in cities projects” the report states. Most urban areas of Kenya are divided between comparatively well-off suburbs and the disadvantaged residing in informal settlements with deficient housing and infrastructure. Youth migrate from rural homes in search of jobs in urban areas only to face reality shock; taking years before they can land themselves something constructive that can generate income. As the long wait continues some turn to criminal activities like house break-ins, shoplifting, mugging, stock theft and commercial sex work in order to cater for their most basic needs. Over the past 20 years more than 75 per cent of the world’s cities have grown more unequally, although the world has made significant progress in reducing poverty since 2000, the report shows.
