Transport along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway was temporarily halted after a car ferrying four family members plunged into River Malewa in Naivasha. During the midday accident, members of the public managed to rescue the four who were on their way to Nakuru. The water was shallow. The accident occurred after the driver lost control of the Toyota Probox carrying the four – who included a minor and a woman – just as it was crossing the bridge. Witness James Kiarie said the vehicle was speeding and overtaking a fleet of cars before it veered off the road and crashed into the guard rails. He said water levels in the river were low. “We managed to rescue the four who were in shock and they have been rushed to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital for a check-up,” he said. Meanwhile, Funyala MP Wilberforce Oundo escaped unscathed after his vehicle was involved in an accident in Naivasha town. The accident occurred after the MP, who was driving the car, swerved to avoid hitting a motorcycle operator, only to land in a trench. Two other occupants also escaped unhurt. The legislator reported to Naivasha police station before proceeding with their journey. Witness Joel Kimani said the MP was entering Naivasha town when the motorcycle operator crossed his path.   He added that the MP and his colleagues had been allowed to proceed with their journey, noting that no one was injured. “Luckily, no one died or was injured,” the police boss said.
