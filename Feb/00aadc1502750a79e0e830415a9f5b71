Young people experience different sexual and reproductive health challenges ranging from retrogressive cultural practices, judgmental attitudes from health care workers, lack of sexual information and finally lack of confidentiality and privacy when seeking health services. These factors have led to low rates of contraceptive use and, therefore, increased cases of teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortion. Young people living with disabilities have been most affected as many reproductive health programmes do not prioritise accessibility to services by persons living with disabilities. Comprehensive sexuality education will ensure young people both in and out of school as well as persons living with disabilities are able to access the information and skills needed to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. Comprehensive sexuality education will also empower young people to adopt safe behaviours and also reduce the incidences of unplanned pregnancies, the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Investing in young people reproductive health creates the potential for development and economic growth. Finally, access to information on contraception and other reproductive health services will allow more girls and young women to remain in school and eventually contribute to the demographic dividend.
