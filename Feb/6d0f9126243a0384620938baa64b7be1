The Central Bank will re-discount the bonds as a last resort at three per cent above the prevailing market yield or coupon rate whichever is higher, upon written confirmation to do so from the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE).

Last month, the government reopened a 10 and five year bonds worth 50 billion placed last year after being under subscribed on low yields of 11.3 and 12.4 per cent respectively. The government is under pressure to finance the 2019/20 budget deficit cheaply after the National Treasury's appetite for expensive external debt was rebuked. Early this month, Treasury CS Ukur Yatani hinted of plans to introduce another supplementary budget to further slash the deficit, citing low revenue collection. While the state is shunning external debt, it is expected to pay higher interests on local debt, especially after the repeal of interest cap law in November that is expected to see banks refocus lending to primary borrowers. Turnover of bonds traded in the domestic secondary market declined by 17.9 percent during the week ending February 13, this according to CBK's weekly bulletin.
