The court has dismissed a petition seeking to annul the election of the Kenya Tea Development Agency, in effect allowing new officials to take office. High Court judge Weldon Korir said the application challenging new directors had no merit and dismissed it. Justice Korir went a step further and affirmed the role of a company secretary in setting election rules, among other things. “The powers of the company secretary are donated by the articles of association of the company to appoint election officials and formulate the rules of the election,” the judge said. The new directors had been barred from taking office for the last two months. Justice Korir's decision arose out of a case filed by Joseph Mbote, Peterson Gathua and Samson Wairugu accusing the company of unilaterally and without authority publishing an election procedure manual, to be used by tea factories for nominees. The elections were held between October and November 2019. The trio also accused the agency of breaching the practices and conducting zonal elections in October, a move they claim shielded some directors from the risk of losing their positions. They further questioned the mandate of the KTDA company secretary as the chief electoral officer. The case was opposed on grounds that farmers were neither shareholders nor members of KTDA and therefore lacked the right to file the matter. The court was also told that the order, which was stopping the new directors from taking office, had a huge impact because it was affecting over 6,000 shareholders who took part in the election. On that issue, the judge held a different view, saying the farmers were entitled to raise issues relating to the election at AGM.
