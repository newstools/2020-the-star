It’s sad that even as Kenya aims at being gender-sensitive and inclusive, most girls are still being told not to attend school or talk to boys when they are on their periods. This speaks volumes about what the government, non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders in education have done concerning the health education for both genders especially on sexual health. For this reason, girls have dropped out of school or even worse– committed suicide for the feeling of being considered dirty and not valued among boys who have also had a wrong perception of menstruation. A lot of awareness needs to be created for society to accept the cycle as a part of life and inevitable. This will, in turn, help women and girls countrywide feel comfortable with the changes their bodies take on. This is why the youths in Mombasa county have stared a ‘No Shame in Menstruation’ walk in towns to help create awareness and correct the perception of society towards menstruation. The campaign is healthy and all county governments should sponsor it in their respective jurisdictions to keep girls in school every day they are required to be. Lack of sanitary pads has pushed some girls in poverty to exchange the crucial commodity for sex with older men and insensitive teachers. Such people if caught should be punished severely for being enemies of development. On the other hand, the male perception has to be changed or the whole drive is crumbled. In most cases, boys have no idea what menstruation is and they use this to victimise girls under the belief that they are sick and should be avoided. Knowledge on the subject will help boys be supportive of girls through the process as a crucial part of life.  Maseno University
