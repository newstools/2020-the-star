Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has ordered the deportation of four Chinese involved in the caning of a Kenyan at Chez Wou Restaurant in Kileleshwa. The four were arrested by the DCI detectives following a viral video showing a Kenyan employee being whipped for arriving late to work. Matiangi's orders on Thursday came hours after the court directed that the four be detained for 15 days pending a police probe. “The court has considered the fact that the suspects are a flight risk and they will abscond court if released. I allow their detention for 15 days,” principal magistrate Hellen Okwani ruled. The prosecution was seeking to detain the four suspects for 21 days. The video of one of the suspects, believed to be Deng Heilan, whipping a waiter for reporting to work late in Kileleshwa went viral on Saturday. The other suspects are Ou Giang, Yu Ling, Chang Yueping. Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng condemned the actions by the suspects, saying all their citizens must abide by the Kenyan laws. Last year, Matiang'i also ordered the deportation of Chinese national Liu Jiaqi following his arrest for referring to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Kenyans as monkeys. Jiaqi was secretly captured in a video by a worker he had threatened to sack from his motorcycle shop in Ruiru.
