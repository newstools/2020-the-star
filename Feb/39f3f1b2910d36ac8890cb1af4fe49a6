Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and Elgeyo Marakwet Kipchumba Murkomen on Saturday stormed out of the BBI rally in Meru. The leaders, who were accompanied by Chuka-Igambang'ombe MP Patrick Munene, left when EALA MP Mpuru Aburi was speaking. It was not clear why they left, but they had earlier missed seats. Only Murkomen and Linturi were allowed to address the gathering after requests from the public. Aburi said it is disrespectful to leave a meeting halfway even if you are offended. Earlier, Murkomen and Kuria once again missed seats at a BBI rally. The first time the two missed seats was during a BBI meeting in Kitui last month. On Saturday they arrived at Kinoru Stadium in Meru for the BBI meeting, but there were no seats left for them the main dias. The two were seen standing behind the podium. Meru Senator Mithika Linturi was also standing.
