A seven-month-old baby died on Tuesday evening after choking on a sweet in Chekalini Central village, Lugari subcounty. The mother, Pauline Wanyonyi, said she gave her son the sweet and went to take a bath. “Upon returning from the bathroom I found the baby on the floor choking,” she said. Wanyonyi rushed him to Chekalini health centre but medics were unable to remove the sweet from the child's windpipe. She was referred to Lumakanda Subcounty Hospital, where the child was pronounced dead on arrival. The body was taken to Chebaiywa Mortuary in the neighbouring Uasin Gishu county. Assistant chief Wilkister Muyoka advised caregivers to avoid giving babies items that could harm them or leaving them unsupervised. "Seven months is too young to be given a sweet to chew on their own. We, however, share in the mother's grief,” she said. Edited by R.Wamochie
