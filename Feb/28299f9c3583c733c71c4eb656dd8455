Dairy farmers in Wundanyi in Taita Taveta county will be trained on handling and production of clean and hygienic milk. Livestock executive Davis Mwangoma said the Kenya Dairy Board-led training will help increase milk production to increase the income of smallholder dairy farmers. “Good standards of hygiene are of the utmost importance for the quality of milk and its products. Milk prices often depend on quality; poor quality milk will be rejected by buyers,” Mwangoma said on Thursday. The training, he said, will also boost milk production to meet the required 10,000-litre demand of Brookside Dairy Kenya’s Wumingu milk plant. The CEC said low production had almost pushed Kenya’s largest milk buyer to close shop in the county. The Ruiru-based company associated with the Kenyatta family had announced plans to close the cooling plant citing underperformance. The decision was reversed, however, after intervention by Governor Granton Samboja. Mwangoma further urged farmers to observe high levels of hygiene to avoid wastage. Unhygienic milk sold to middlemen and the local market posed a threat of disease outbreak, he said. “Milk quality and hygiene play a vital role in the production system and should not be underestimated." Milking, transportation and storage determine the milk quality, he added. Last week, Brookside's director of milk procurement and manufacturing John Gethi said the company will also partner with the county in the training. He said the current interventions will eventually lead to a reduction in the cost of production by improving the overall efficiencies along the value chain. He asked farmers to double their efforts in milk production that would lead to maximum utilisation of the plant. Edited by R.Wamochie
