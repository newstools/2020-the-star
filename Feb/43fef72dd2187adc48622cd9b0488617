Uasin Gishu county in a joint operation with the police impounded more than 10 tonnes of contraband wheat that was to be sold to unsuspecting Kenyans for consumption. The rotten wheat had been put out to dry in the open next to the National Cereals and Produce Board stores. The suspects were planning to mix it with some good wheat before taking it to the market. Speaking during the crackdown, Health Services executive Everlyne Rotich said that the county government will not entertain people engaging in unscrupulous business, warning that they will be arrested and prosecuted. She also urged the public to notify authorities of any other suspicious activities or trade. Agriculture executive Silas Yego also urged farmers to observe proper storage of farm produce to avoid losses and risks of food poisoning. This is even as DCI detectives arrested two people and seized a consignment of wheat flour being repackaged in a house at Siranga, Dandora, Nairobi county. Uasin Gishu residents fear that some of the flour might have already found its way to the market. In September, Kenya Bureau of Standards and public health officials seized expired cooking oil, rice, sugar and flour worth Sh20 million in Eldoret The recovery followed a countrywide crackdown on contraband, counterfeit, and substandard goods. In June, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i said the war on illicit goods would continue until all the illegal dealerships are wiped out. The CS  has on several occasions promised to end illegal imports on Kenyan borders.
