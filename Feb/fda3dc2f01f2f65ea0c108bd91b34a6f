President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent his condolences to the family of Kahawa Wundanyi MCA who died on Thursday. Cyrus Omondi was a Jubilee party vibrant member who became the first person from the Lakeside region to be part of the Kiambu county assembly. He was part of the county Education Committee that attended a workshop in India. Deputy President William Ruto also said he was saddened by Omondi's death. Ruto added that the MCA was a dedicated servant to his people and the Jubilee Party. According to Kiambu county assembly speaker Stephen Ndichu, Omondi died after suffering a heart attack. Macharia, popularly known as Taki, said Omondi’s death has come as a shock to the Kiambu county assembly, given he was in good health. Thika District Business Association chairman Alfred Wanyoike said that the county has lost a great leader and a philanthropist.
