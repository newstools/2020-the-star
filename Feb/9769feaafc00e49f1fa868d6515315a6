Cartoon Network is set to hit the party scene in Kenya on February 29. Africa’s leading kids’ entertainment channel will bring on the excitement and adrenalin with brand-new Pop Up Party video clips shot across some of Kenya’s iconic locations, featuring nine talented local dancing dynamites. Premiering as part of a unique Cartoon Network dance-themed stunt called ‘Let’s Dance’, the new videos will showcase amazing dances that will tempt viewers to join the party with dazzling Afro dance styles. The project ropes in Kenyan musical and dancing heavyweights Bruce ‘Bruz’ Newton and Jackson ‘Jack Jack on the Beat’ Maina. Cartoon Network will take the beat to locations from Ngong Hills and the helipad of the KICC, to the iconic streets in Nairobi in-between the matatu minibuses, known for blaring out loud music. The talented local youngsters will show off their astounding dancing skills. Ariane Suveg, Programming Director and Head of Kids Content for Africa, says they are thrilled to launch this video-clip series shot in Kenya. "Having its roots all over Africa, Cartoon Network wants to celebrate this vibrant continent and its different cultures through original content and programming,” he said. The launch will be on Cartoon Network, DStv, channel 301 and GOtv, channel 67 (Ghana 158 and Uganda 356).
