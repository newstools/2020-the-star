Fiery Ugandan striker Jimmy Bageya has challenged his teammates to take their eye off the ball as they seek to return back to the top-flight league. The diminutive forward was in the scoresheet as Nairobi City Stars came out 2-1 on top in their clash with Bidco at Camp Toyoyo yesterday. Anthony Kimani scored the other goal for Sanjit Alagic’s National Super League leaders with A rise Zamu responding for the visitors. “We are on the right track with our performances and the results also. Winning against a tough team like Bidco shows the desire we have as a team to achieve our target of returning to KPL,” said Bageya. His sentiments were echoed by assistant coach and former club captain John Amboko who insisted they will have to keep their feet on the ground despite the increasing likelihood of them regaining promotion. “We know it’s still a long way off for us to think about promotion but if we keep playing the way we are and maintain our focus then we will surely achieve our objective. As a team we are just thinking of the next game and performing to our level,” he remarked. The victory saw City Stars saw open up a 10-point gap against second-placed  Bidco. After 22 games City Stars have 55 points while Bidco  have amassed 45. “We are disappointed with the result because I thought we played well and deserved to get something out of the game. We must learn from this result and ensure we bounce back in the next game,” said Bidco tactician Anthony Akhulia.
