Despite low tenant occupancy levels in the retail market, Signature Mall has managed to secure an anchor tenant to boost footfall. The mixed-use development comprising of retail, commercial, conference halls and a hotel located along Mombasa road got a reprieve after Chandarana Food Plus agreed to come on board as the mall’s anchor tenant. “With a fast-growing population of Syokimau, Mlolongo, Sabaki area, Athi River and Kitengela areas we urge residents to visit the mall and shop with us,” Chandarana Food Plus general manager Hanif Rajan said. The store will be offering a wide range of in-store options such as the deli, bakery and fruit and vegetable section on the 28,000 square feet space. An oversupply in the local retail market space coupled with the country’s tough economic environment has seen a number of mall developers struggle to get stalls occupied. Knight Frank’s Kenya market update for 2020 shows occupancy levels in retail market space averaged 77 per cent last year.  This has forced a number of mall-owners to introduce concessions as they compete to retain existing occupants and attract new ones. “In most malls, sales are down with tenancy occupancy rate at an all-time low,” Knight Frank Kenya managing director Ben Woodhams said.
