Greensharks' captain Victor Osiche has challenged the club's new signings to quickly adopt to the team's style of play and the demands of playing in the Premier League. The team signed four players, three of whom are from the lower tiers including Byron Oyigo, Brown Wekesa, Rioba Leonard and Eddy Odhiambo. will have to compete for a place in the already star-studded team. Osiche is convinced that the quartet will prove to be bargain signings overtime but called for patience even as they battle for starting roles in the already star-studded team. "We have acquired effective players, not big signings. They will have an impact this season. They are promising and need to iron out their basics," Osiche said. "They need to understand our system of play since playing for Greensharks is tough since we approach games with different formations. We fielded two teams deliberately in the Parklands tournament to see the output and different partnerships. We are trying to let everyone familiarise with the system," he added. Osiche believes Greensharks is the team to watch this season and is banking on the players' maturity to put them in the frame for the title. "This is our season. We still have our players from last season, who have matured significantly. We have added depth to complement our tough fighting spirit and experience. We just pray that we have a fully fit squad throughout the season," he added. Osiche backed the decision to sign two goalkeepers, who were a priority after conceding 32 goals, a league-high amongst the top six teams. "We conceded easy goals, not because of the defence but because there are goals you cannot assist the goalkeeper to save. Change was inevitable" The team had a goal difference of one to compound a disappointing fourth-place finish.
