Baringo chiefs and their assistants have appealed for police support so that they can crack down on alcoholism in respect of former President Daniel Moi. Moi, who died on February 4, was laid to rest in his Kabarak home in Nakuru county yesterday. “Former President Moi shall be remembered for his tireless fight against illicit brew,” Talai chief Thomas Chepyegon said on Tuesday. Chepyegon said Mzee Moi helped in the closure of bars and local brew joints by assigning two or three armed Administration Police officers to chiefs. “The officers would assist the chiefs and their assistants to pursue and arrest criminals including the illegal brewers and dealers,” he said. The policy ceased after Moi left power. Chepyegon was backed by his counterparts Patrick Kiprop (Ewalel), Vincent Kipsang (Ng’etmoi), Richard Chepcheng (Kabosgei-Kerio) and Simon Cheraste (Kelio). They cited the case of senior Ossen-Kabartonjo chief Jeremiah Chepkwony Kendele who was attacked and hacked to death by an illicit brew vendor in 2015. The chiefs also noted an increase in ‘careless’ licensing of bars selling illicit alcohol in the county compared to the Moi era. Apart from putting their lives on the line, the chiefs say are being harassed by their bosses, pushing them to use all means within their mandate to apprehend the alcoholics.
