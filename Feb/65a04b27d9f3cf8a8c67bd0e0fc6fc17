Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was blocked from entering the main dais during the funeral service for the late president Daniel Arap Moi. Sonko arrived at the funeral service after President Uhuru Kenyatta had arrived. The governor came in minutes after ODM leader Raila Odinga. However, Raila was allowed to take his reserved seat. Security officers were seen whisking the governor away from the main dais. The funeral service to pay the last respect to the second president Mzee Moi is underway at Kabarak University grounds. Thousands of Kenyans have turned up to show their last respect to Moi. Mzee Moi's body was flown from Wilson Airport on Wednesday morning by the military chopper. Government officials including the Cabinet Secretaries are attending Mzee Moi's funeral service. He died on February 4 at the Nairobi Hospital at the age of 95.
