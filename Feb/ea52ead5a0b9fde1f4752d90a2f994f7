Busia county staff who fail to declare their income, assets and liabilities will have their salaries stopped. County Public Service Board Finance and Administration director Martin Sikolia said it's mandatory for staff to fill wealth declaration forms by December 31 every year. " It will not be a walk in the park in 2021, officers who will fail to fill the forms by the set deadline will cease to be on the payroll and they risk a fine of Sh1 million or a jail term of one year," he said. Sikolia was addressing the new staff in the department of Water, Irrigation, Environment and Natural Resources during an induction course. He told the new staff to adhere to work etiquette, noting that those who will discharge their duties to the contrary will be retired. A member of the board Patrick Afwande told the staff to count themselves lucky to get an induction course before they assume office. He told them to work diligently and adhere to their own values and principles and to serve people better and progress in their careers. "Observe ethics by virtue of being public servants, Don't stagnate, dream that you will advance through hard work and education career," he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
