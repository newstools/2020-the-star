Coach cliff Owuor is plotting to revamp United States International University (men) and women teams into formidable sides ahead of next season. “We have already started our preparations for the new season.  It is a process to restore our lost glory and I am sure we will be back,” said Owuor. The ladies team, 'The Flames', who are two-time national champions, survived the axe that took Africa Nazarene University and Western Delight down the lower division. “I have all my girls who did duty for us last year. I can assure you that the team will make the playoffs this year,” said Owuor, who is also the national team coach. The men’s side ‘Tigers’, he noted, will also climb back to the Premiership after being relegated last year. “The rebuilding has started and all is promising,” he assured. “As we speak, the Tigers are playing in a tournament in Kisumu and the results show they are doing well. They are determined to return to the top again,” he added. In a related development, Eldonets coach Maurice Ouma also promised that his boys will make a strong finish in this year’s title race. He said none of his players had left— an indication that they can improve their performance this year. He added: “Our sponsor has promised they will be with us for another year and this is encouraging news. We will make them happy.”
