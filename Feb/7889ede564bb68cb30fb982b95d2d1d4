Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai has said all the static traffic officers along the roads will be removed. Mutyambai who did not give reasons why the officers are being removed, said they will be replaced by mobile traffic officers. The IG spoke on Monday at the Police Pavilion in South C, Nairobi after receiving 19 vehicles from the National Transport and Safety Authority. He noted that all the Regional Commanders will also be facilitated with efficient means of transport. Mutyambai said the 38 vehicles will be used by the Police Traffic Department across the major highways across the country to control traffic. "The vehicles are marked. Serial number 1-38 and the routes. The vehicles will also be provided with the registration numbers and the names of the officers," Mutyambai said. The IG said the registration on each vehicle will enable the leadership of the National Police Service to take action against the police officers whose complaints will be raised. He said they will continue engaging with NTSA to provide them with more facilitation in order to meet citizen's expectations. Deputy Inspector General Edward Â Njoroge Mbugua said during the event that there will no longer be detention of drivers by traffic police over minor offences. Mbugua said traffic officers will only be deployed to ensure that there is a smooth flow of traffic in specific areas. "Traffic officers on duty should have a uniform while on duty... have tags with their name...and should not be covered by jackets," Mbugua said. NTSA director general George Njao did not attend the ceremony. In 2018, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced drastic safety measures to tame road carnage, including redeployment of 300 police officers who were attached to NTSA. The President had said changes were reached following complaints and runaway road accidents that soared fatalities to alarming levels in the festive season.
