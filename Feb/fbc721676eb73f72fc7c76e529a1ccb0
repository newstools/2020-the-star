Child labour at Kalokol  in Lake Turkana is fueling the spread of HIV, the National Aids Control Council has disclosed County NACC coordinator Bernard Mwaura said underage boys and girls are being exploited for fishing activities by fisher folk who engage them in commercial sex. "There is a need to address these cases of child labour if the county is to win the war against HIV/Aids. The minors are lured by fisher folk and businessmen at Lake Turkana who take advantage of the poverty of underage boys and girls to engage them in commercial sex, " he said. Mwaura said concerted efforts by various health stakeholders had helped reduce the prevalence rate from 7.6 percent in 2011 to the current 3.2 per cent.
