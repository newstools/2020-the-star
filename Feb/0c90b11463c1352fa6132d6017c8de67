Former Miss Tanzania Wema Sepetu has blamed her baby woes on her failed relationship with the late actor Stephen Kanumba. Speaking during an interview on her Wema App, the former Miss Tanzania opened up about having two abortions during the relationship. The first one, she said, was as a result of Wema and Kanumba agreeing to it, while the second one was done without the late actor’s consent. The reason for both abortions was that Wema felt she was too young to have kids back then. “I feel like Kanumba cursed me. This is because he wanted to see me, he would call every day two weeks before his death,” she said. "We were to meet but we were super busy and could not. He called for like four times but we could not meet. We finally met at Bilcanas."
