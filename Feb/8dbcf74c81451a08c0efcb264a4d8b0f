Africa junior cross country champion Nicholas Kimeli will be seeking a return to the continental front when the country selects a team to the African championships set for Lome, Togo at the Ngong Racecourse tomorrow. Kimeli, who was a finalist in the 5,000m race at the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Qatar will lead Central Rift region in the 10km contest alongside World Under 18 2000m steeplechase silver medalist Cleophas Kandie, Edwin Kiplagat, Titus Kimutai and Evans Keitany. “I will return to Africa as a senior runner, hoping to pull a surprise. I know Kenyans are disappointed for letting them down in Qatar but I am hoping to perform well and redeem my image in Togo,” said Kimeli. Former Africa Junior bronze medalist Nancy Chepkwemoi and Nelson Mandela half marathon silver medalist Sarah Naibei will headline the women's team. Also hoping to make Team Kenya to Togo is Julius Tanki, who, despite outperforming himself on the local scene for year's, has failed to represent the country in international championships. “It has been a long journey, performing well in many races across the country but failing to represent Kenya at international championships. I have won many races locally but when it comes to national trials, I always fail to make the cut,” said Tanki. The Bomet-based runner trains alongside world under 20 3,000m steeplechase silver medalist Leonard Bett. He won the South Rift Athletics Kenya Cross Country title about three weeks ago in 28:34 ahead of Leonard Lang'at (28:35) and Edwin Kosge (29:02). “My mind and spirit is focused on African championships,” said Tanki. “This is my year of prosperity. I am in top form and even though it is my debut in cross country, I know big results await.”
