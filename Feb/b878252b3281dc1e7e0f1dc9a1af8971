It’s a new era for Kiss TV after the station relaunched and changed a little bit of its look on Friday evening. The event was graced by your favourite presenters Angeline Wanjeri, DJ Kym Nickdee of the hottest show “Afterburn”, behind-the-scenes personnel and so many others. Raphael Gikonyo, Kiss TV shows director, said on Friday that fans should expect "amazing programming". "We are focusing more on entertainment and mix it up with fashion, events and music. This time around, there will be amazing programming. You will also get to know more about your favourite celebrities through these shows," he said. New TV sensation Maria is an addition to the TV station, who will be having a  great show called “Mash-Up” every Saturday from 9-11pm. Gikonyo added that Maria’s show will be for DJ battles. "Two DJs will come to battle it out and fans get to choose who they want to battle the next episode," he said. Kiss continues to give you a dose of your favourite entertainment, music and live shows. Its sister channel Kiss FM was ranked the third-most-listened to station in numbers published by international research firm Geopoll last year. Classic FM and Radio Jambo, all from Radio Africa, topped the ranking. In a previous interview, Radio Africa CEO Patrick Quarcoo said Kiss TV was formed with the intention of a one-stop shop for local and international entertainment programmes. "There will be lots of Kenya music videos and lots that currently don’t get any showing. Some 50-60 per cent of the channel will be devoted to Kenyan videos and more if we can find the quality," he said. Kiss TV was launched in early August 2009. It was relaunched in 2013 before the current rebranding. As a 24-hour entertainment channel, Kiss TV seeks to capture the youth as it brings to them entertainment that can compete with even the premium channels in pay-TV stations.
