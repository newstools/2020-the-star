Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny has asked the police to refrain from arresting men whose only offence is to look for girlfriends at night. He said these men are forced to pay a fine of up to Sh50,000 for mere strolls as early as 8pm. Kutuny further joked that ODM leader Raila Odinga has become light-skinned ever since he joined hands with President Uhuru Kenyatta. "Tangu akae na Uhuru amebadilika rangi. Nimeona amekua mweupe na ameongeza kitambi. (Since Raila joined hands with Uhuru, he has become light-skinned and has even added weight)," the legislator said. He spoke on Saturday during the BBI meeting in Kinoru Stadium, Meru county. Nominated MP Maina Kamanda said more than two million people from Mt Kenya living in Nairobi were the first to appreciate the March 9, 2018, handshake between Uhuru and Raila because they understood the problems they face. Education CAS Zack Kinuthia said Cabinet positions for the youths in the national and county governments must be 20 per cent. Kinuthia said the time is ripe for the youths to benefit from the promises that were made to them by the government "This is no time for promises, but for fulfilling the promises made earlier," he said Kinuthia also urged the government to release the innovation and business funds allocated to benefit youth with business ideas. "The 75 per cent who are youth should be in the leadership of the country."
