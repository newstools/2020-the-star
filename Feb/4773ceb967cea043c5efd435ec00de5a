At least three health insurance firms have dropped Nairobi Women's Hospital from their list of service providers following allegations of malpractice. The firms are CIC, AAR and Old Mutual. A series of WhatsApp messages released on Twitter last week showed doctors calling staff to ensure they meet their targets by all means necessary, including making patients who had recuperated stay on longer. However, a statement by the Nairobi Women's Hospital board dated February 3 cast doubt on the authenticity of the messages. It said, "Although we don't believe this is the case and it is in face antithetical to our foundational principles, we take these allegations very seriously and are conducting an internal review as well as cooperating with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board." The insurance firms advised their clients to seek medical services from other healthcare providers in their panel. CIC cited administrative concerns when suspending services at Nairobi Women's Hospital. It said in a statement on Tuesday, "Due to some administrative concerns, we wish to notify you that the services at the Nairobi Women's Hospital will be suspended from February 5,2020." The firm said it was working towards a resolution of the concerns raised. Old Mutual, on the other hand, said cash payments to the facility would not be reimbursable. It also cited administrative concerns. AAR urged clients to seek services at other outlets. "We are committed to continuing to offer you unparalleled medical services through our expansive panel..."
