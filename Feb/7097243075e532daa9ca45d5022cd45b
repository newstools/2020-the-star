Four gold miners died and 15 others are nursing injuries in hospitals after Osiri mines in Migori collapsed. Six of the injured are in critical condition. The tragedy happened on Wednesday evening after Osiri Matanda gold mines in Nyatike subcounty caved in. On Thursday morning there were fears that more miners might still be trapped in debris as search operations were ongoing. Area chief David Oulo said the miners were prospecting for gold in the area known for its rich mineral deposits when the mine collapsed, burying them alive. “Three bodies were badly mutilated after being crushed. The other suffocated to death  when he was held in a tight spot. The others were treated at Macalder hospital. The others were rushed to referral hospital,” Oulo said. According to the administrator, more people are still trapped in the debris although they were yet to establish the exact number. “There are conflicting reports on the exact number of the miners who were working here. Some say  they were 40 while others claim they were only 15. We are still tallying the number,” he said. He said the search operations would continue until all the victims are found.
