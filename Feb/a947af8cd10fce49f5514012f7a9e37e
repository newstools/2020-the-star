Former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo and former Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn have expressed their admiration and support for the Handshake and the Building Bridges Initiative. The two who are in Kenya to launch their book "The Asian Aspiration Why and How Africa Should Emulate Asia", said the BBI is a model for African countries and needed the unity necessary to prosper. In addition, they presented their advice on measures that can be undertaken that will rapidly provide jobs to young Kenyans. They met ODM party leader Raila Odinga who spoke to them of the national desire for unity and prosperity underpinning the BBI process. Also meeting with the leaders was Senator Mohamed Haji, the Chairperson of the BBI Steering Committee. The dignitaries were handed the BBI report by Haji. They, in turn, presented their advice on areas, that are in the BBI report, that aim at developing sufficient jobs for Kenyans.
