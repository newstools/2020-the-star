Two siblings on Thursday drowned in a 10-foot-deep well in church compound at Ng'ege sub-location of Suna East subcounty. Assistant chief Seline Anyango Okello said the siblings were aged two and three. They were reportedly rushing home from the Power of Jesus Around the World Church when it started raining and they slipped inside the well. “Their bodies were found late on Thursday evening by a teenager who came to fetch water from the well  in the compound,” Anyango said. The administrator warned any individual or organisation with open wells or any source of water to fence them to avoid such incidents. Resident Edward Geko said the open well has existed for 10 years. He accused the church members of negligence saying no one bothered to fence the well. Suna East community policing chairman Nashon Ondoro said action shall be taken to the church if they fail to relocate or fence the well. “Their mother had a rough time raising the kid and the pain of losing two innocent siblings in a village was an unwelcoming scene,” Ondoro said. He said the church will be charged with manslaughter. Their bodies were taken to Migori Referral Hospital morgue. Edited by R.Wamochie
