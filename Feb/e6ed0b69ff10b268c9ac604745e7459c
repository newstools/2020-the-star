Detectives have arrested two people suspected of hacking into the National Transport and Safety Authority database and TIMS system The DCI said on Twitter that a team of digital forensic experts and Serious Crime Unit officers raided the duo's office in Ngara after receiving a tip-off. Among those arrested is NTSA employee Antony Korir 33, who police say was assisting the hackers to access the authority's network. Police suspect Korir connected a Local Area Network turtle gadget, a covert system administration and pen-testing tool to get stealth remote access to NTSA systems. The two are in custody as investigations proceed. The detectives seized several USB drives and other computer hardware. The arrest comes a week after NTSA dismissed a Facebook page that claimed to facilitate the replacement of current driving licenses with digital ones. The message was posted on Facebook and widely circulated among online users. The Star did a fact check on this claim.
