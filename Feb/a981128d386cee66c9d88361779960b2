One of the security officers who was on duty at Harambee Annex office when the alleged Sh39 billion fake military arms deal was being signed has gone missing. The officer, who was expected to record a statement, has not been seen for two days now. A source told the Star that the officer who was scheduled to appear before DCI over the case has not done so. "A search for the officer has been launched. So far five security officers have recorded statements," the source added on Thursday. Deputy President William Ruto wrote to IG Hillary Mutyambai to speed up investigations into the role of Echesa in his involvement in the arms deal. Echesa was charged with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud. He was also charged alongside three others with six counts of making a false document in the multibillion-shilling scam. In a letter seen by the Star on Wednesday, Ruto asked the police to establish who accessed his office and how the police officers cleared them. On Tuesday, Echesa claimed that he was friends with Ruto, adding that he could see him without an appointment. "Ruto is my friend and I don't need an appointment to see him," he said. Ruto's office on Tuesday said Echesa did not access his private office, but rather the waiting room.
