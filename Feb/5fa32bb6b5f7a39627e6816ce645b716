Two suspects are being sought by the DCI boss George Kinoti for defrauding an individual Sh300 million. The two, Rose Omamo Adhiambo and Dillion Kibet are among a gang of criminals who have already been arrested believed to be dealing in fake gold. "We appeal for information that may lead to the arrest of Rose Omamo Adhiambo and Dillon Kibet," the DCI tweeted on Wednesday. "The two alongside others who have already been arraigned are suspected to have defrauded their victim USD 3,000,000 in a fake gold scam." The warrants of arrest were issued by the Chief Magistrate's Court at Milimani. The DCI added that information that may lead to their arrest can be forwarded to them or to the Officer in Charge Serious Crime- DCI Headquarters  Block B, 2nd-floor room 8. In November last year, a Congolese national was arrested at JKIA by DCI detectives who were working jointly with Immigration Department officers. Ledivin Mupanga was nabbed on arrival from Ethiopia following a stop order that had been placed by Serious Crime Detectives. The 41-year-old suspect is accused of obtaining Sh10 million in March this year from a complainant with the false promise that he could purchase gold for him and thereafter disappeared.
