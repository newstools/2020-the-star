Comedian Churchill says one of his former bosses told him his brain was full of mucus. He was working in Industrial Area those days. He said the boss told him, "Toka hapa, jinga. Hapa hapana iko mama yako." Recounting the incident, the presenter said he had walked to Huruma to Mtindwa before going to Industrial Area. "I was very hurt when I imagined I had not eaten for many hours. He even told me my brain was full of mucus," he said. Churchill was responding to the arrest of four Chinese nationals at Kilimani after a video of one of them caning a Kenyan staffer in Nairobi emerged. The four men, who run Chez Wou Restaurant in the suburb Kileleshwa, were arrested for beating Simon Sairo for coming late to work. Churchill added, "That is killing ‘family’ and the generations to come. The reason why I stopped working with such people was disrespect."
