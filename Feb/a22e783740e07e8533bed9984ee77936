Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has appointed 13 chief officers almost a year after he fired those who occupied the positions due to poor performance. Tolgos fired the chief officers early last year but has taken many months to replace them due to intense lobbying for the positions. The new chief officers were sworn in on Monday by Iten senior principal magistrate Charles Kutwa. “I expect full dedication and honesty from you because residents of Elgeyo Marakwet expect nothing else but service,” Tolgos as he witnessed the ceremony. The new team consists of Mary Jemutai Kipchumba (health and sanitation), Sharon Jepkorir Sirma (administration and project management), Benson Kibore (livestock, cooperatives and fisheries), Geofrey Kipkemboi Kimaiyo (roads and public works) and Josphat Tanui (lands). Others are Lorna Jepng'etich Kipsang (tourism), Loreta Jeptoo Kotuutt (public Service), Timothy Koech Kiptum (economic planning), Mark Kipkosgei Chesergon (office of the governor), Nickson Changwony (finance) and Josephat Kipchumba Maiyo (youth, sports and ICT). Edwin Kibet Seroney will be in charge of agriculture and Nicholas Kipkemboi Bett  education and technical training. Pauline Jeruto Kurgat  and Selly Jemutai Kimosop joined the  County Public Service Board as members. Chief officers are the accounting officers of county departments headed by county executives who constitute the cabinet chaired by the governor. The chief officers implement the county budget. Elgeyo Marakwet receives about Sh3.7 billion annually from Treasury.
