Residents of Taita in Nkubu are opposed to the upgrading of the town, saying they fear losing their land. The residents say the ongoing integrated urban strategic planning will affect their lives and lead to evictions. Former MCA Nick Mburugu and current area MCA Martin Makasi said the residents are opposed to the project, saying it might turn some landowners into squatters. Mburugu said they could not forget the compulsory acquisition without compensation of their chunks of land that now hosts churches, schools, police stations and government offices. But Nkubu town board chair Kaburu Mugambi dismissed the claims of likely forceful land acquisitions and said the county had no intention to make the town a municipality. On Tuesday, a meeting to collect public views on the plan ended in chaos after bitter exchanges between rival groups at Shabaha stadium in Nkubu town. Opponents say there was no public participation. They say land rates will increase, taxes hiked, rents go up and that some buildings will be demolished. Mugambi said public participation was conducted in 2015 where Mburugu, chiefs and community approved the 2015-2035 plan. Mugambi distanced the office from claims of grabbing of land and merging of nine markets incorporated in the plan. “You can’t get donors to fund any development project without the town being planned. This is politics. The integrated urban development plan is under one consultant for all of the nine markets but each market is planned separately and will ran independently," he said. "So, Nkubu will not be extended to Mikimbune, Kanyakine or Mwiciune. People had endorsed the plan in 2015 but politicians have interfered with the process. It has succeeded in other 13 markets not only in Nkubu.”
