A man has urged the High Court to compel a judge in his land case to leave the matter over alleged bias. Joseph Njoroge wants Justice Loice Komingoi to stop handling his case against land seller Harrison Munyui. Njoroge says the judge has a fixed impression about him hence cannot be impartial in the matter. He claims that on the hearing of an earlier application, the judge ordered him to be silent and to only respond to questions from her. The complainant alleges that Justice Komingoi allowed the defendant to explain their case while he was not given right of response. “It was an act of bias and prejudice aimed at disadvantaging me during the hearing of the application,” he says. Court documents say Njoroge bought a parcel of land in Kiambaa/Ruaka measuring 0.074 hectares from Munyui on February 1, 2008. “I immediately took possession of the land and built my family home besides other buildings that help me do chicken farming,” he explained. Around 2012, Njoroge says he was approached by a man who introduced himself as James Ndungu and laid a claim to the same land parcel. He went to court to secure his ownership of the property and was represented by two lawyers. Njoroge, however, started representing himself last year after years of case stagnation as he felt that the court was not granting him a fair hearing.
