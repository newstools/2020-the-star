  The Narok Stadium has been renamed in honour of veteran Masaai politician William Ole Ntimama who died on September 1, 2016. The renaming was unveiled by the former Prime Minister Raila Odinga during a meeting of the Building Bridges Initiative in Narok. Narok Governor Samuel Tunai and Kajiado's Joseph Lenku welcomed Raila as he made a lap of honour around the stadium. Sports and Culture CS Amina Mohammed said the William Ole Ntimama Stadium will be upgraded to national standards by the government in honour of the former minister. Raila said Ntimama earned a lot of respect from his Maa community and other Kenyans because he took a stand in protecting his people. "I also respect Ntimama because he stood for the rights of the Maasai. He loved his people. Giving this stadium his name is a great honour," Raila said. Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru was present. Ole Ntimama was a very popular politician among the Maa community. He was a staunch supporter of the then ruling party KANU, prior to the adoption of the multiparty politics in Kenya in 1990. He was vocal against multi-party politics like many diehard Kanu supporters at the time. However, after the advent of multi-partyism, he decamped from KANU and joined the Democratic Party (DP), then headed by retired President Mwai Kibaki. Ole Ntimama later joined the Orange Democratic Movement during the 2007 general elections. He was elected to represent the Narok North constituency in the National Assembly in 2007. He announced his retirement from politics on September 14, 2013. Ole Ntimama announced that he had joined the Jubilee Party headed by President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 12, 2016 where he led a delegation of Maa leaders to State House.
