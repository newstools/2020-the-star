ODM party leader Raila Odinga has left the country for the United States. Raila is expected to attend the National Prayer Breakfast to be held on 6th February 2020 in Washington, DC. According to his personal assistant Dennis Onyango,  Raila is scheduled to speak at the International Luncheon on reconciliation, organised by the US National Prayer breakfast team before the prayers. The luncheon address will take place on 5th February 2020. "Raila left the country shortly before 6 PM on Sunday and is scheduled to hold a Round-table meeting with African Ambassadors in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, 4th February 2020, ahead of the Prayer Breakfast activities," read part of a statement to newsrooms. Raila will brief the Ambassadors on the Continent’s Infrastructure and continental trade agenda. "Mr Odinga is also scheduled to attend the African Senate Dinner hosted for Heads of State from Africa and Africa delegation by the Prayer Breakfast team," the statement noted. Unconfirmed reports also indicate that president Uhuru Kenyatta will be joining Raila later as both were invited to speak about the handshake. In April last year, Raila joined Uhuru in  China when he sought an additional Sh368 billion loan to extend the SGR to Western. The president attended the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) forum in China before proceeding to Saudi Arabia.
