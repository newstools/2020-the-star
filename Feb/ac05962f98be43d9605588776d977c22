One of the late president Daniel Moi's son, Raymond recounted his father's journey from his private life to being President in a moving eulogy at the Kabarak University grounds. Raymond also read the eulogy during Moi's state memorial service at Nyayo International Stadium on Tuesday. Like the previous day, he started by describing Moi's family, his parents, wife and children. He then read through his education, teaching career and entry to politics. Philip Moi, another of Moi's sons also read the scripture, Revelations 14:13, the same one he read on Tuesday. At one point as he read the eulogy yesterday while detailing Mzee Moi's children,Â  Raymond had a light moment when he reminded mourners that he was one of them. Moi had eight children, among them a set of twins. Moi's firstborn is Jenniffer Chemutai, second-born Jonathan Toroitich who died in 2019, John Mark, Rongai MP, Raymond, after him Moi had twins, Philip and Doris, Gideon is his last born. After the service, Moi will be accorded a private burial at his Kabarak home in the afternoon.
