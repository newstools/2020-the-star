Citizen TV’s Willis Raburu and his wife Marya Prude have uniquely honoured their stillborn daughter Adana by getting tattoos of their little angel. The duo lost their expected firstborn during birth a few weeks ago, and the grief has been too much to bear. The young couple on Sunday visited popular tattoo artist Barry Tusker and got tattoos of their little angel. Marya’s tattoo was of the daughter’s name Adana, while Raburu had the first letter of his child’s name with a crown on top and the date she died. "I will never forget. Rest in Palaces, my Queen," the Citizen TV presenter wrote, accompanied by the photo. Marya had complications during pregnancy that led to a stillbirth. Raburu announced the death on their firstborn child through social media. He wrote, "We got into labour but there were some complications and a clot so we pushed out a stillbirth." Raburu is back on air. Below are messages from their fans. Carol Leyian: It is well, good things God has planned ahead of u.Take heart and be strong. Mercy Chege: Beautifully done.
