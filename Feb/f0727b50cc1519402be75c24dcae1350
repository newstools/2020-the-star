Despite being out of action for more than one and a half months, Strathmore are fitter and raring to go. The varsity side play Makueni Bees in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) National League this Sunday. Coach Peter Mwathi has said his charges will play for maximum points as they target top spot. The students are placed second in the 25-team league with 24 points. "Basically we have to approach the game with the seriousness it deserves and the boys know what is expected of them. Our fitness levels are up to date as the team has been active in the University league," said the national team coach. Mwathi said they will not humiliate their opponents since they are inexperienced but will be seeking to win with respectable margin. "We don't want to punish them neither are we going to embarrass them on the score sheet. They are young boys and first-timers but we will play our game.  We need to be solid defensively to maintain our structure of the play." Strathmore will take control of the table should they win. The Bees are 15th on the log and have further fixtures against Nanyuki, Gunners and St. Paul's University. Nanyuki have lost nine times in 12matches to register six points while the Gunners are bottom with two points. Elsewhere, unbeaten Ulinzi men's side will move to the eighth spot with victory over Generation. The soldiers, who will battle Technical University of Kenya TUK,  occupy 11th place. Meanwhile, University of Nairobi  confront National Youth Service as Gunners ruffle feathers with Inspired Boys. In the women category, Ulinzi take on Rising Stars who also have a fixture against National Cereals and Produce Board. Nairobi Water play NYS.
