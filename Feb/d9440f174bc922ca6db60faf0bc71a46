Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua has recalled how she and the late and former President Daniel Moi worked together despite being at loggerheads on several occasions. She advised politicians to put their differences aside and work together. "We must learn from the past, avoid the mistakes that we committed and strengthen the good things that we did," Karua said. Karua spoke at Mzee Moi's Kabarnet Gardens home in Nairobi, where she and other politicians went to condole with the family. "I'm privileged not just to have worked with the father, but also with Gideon during my time in Parliament. This is a family I can say I know from those two individuals whom I worked with," she said. Former Jubilee Vice-Chairman David Murathe echoed Karua's sentiments labelingÂ Moi a good man. "When all is said and done, Mzee was a good man sisi ndo watoto wa nyayo and if there is something that has happened in life and in death is uniting this country," he said. Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju also reiterated the importance of Moi's participation in instilling peace in the country. "He told us that the era of multipartism was going to result in tribalism but we didn't take him seriously, unfortunately what he said has come to pass," he said. Tuju noted that Jubilee is struggling to find the right way to unite the country as he did. "Moi brought a culture in which even when people disagree they are able to come together," he said.
