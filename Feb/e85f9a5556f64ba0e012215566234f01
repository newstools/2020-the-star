 The High Court on Wednesday okayed the deportation of four Chinese nationals arrested for allegedly assaulting an employee at their premises in Nairobi. The decision followed a request by the Deng Heilan, Ou Giang, Yu Ling and Chang Yueping to withdraw an application challenging an order for their deportation. Consequently, the state has also withdrawn charges of assault against the four. Appearing at the Milimani court before Justice Luka Kimaru on Tuesday, the four said they were willing to be deported because they had suffered a lot. The state withdrew the charges citing the court's decision to allow the deportation as was ordered by Interior CS Fred Matiangi’s on February 13. A viral video showed Heilan whipping a waiter for reporting to work late. Last week, the deportation order was suspended following an application by the four suspects that also challenged their 15-day detention directive. Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng condemned the actions by the suspects, saying all their citizens must abide by the Kenyan law. The Chinese nationals were arrested on February 9 after a Helian was captured on video caning the waiter at Chez Wou restaurant in Kileleshwa, Nairobi. On February 13, principal magistrate Hellen Okwani directed that the four be detained for 15 days to allow police complete investigations on assault allegations. The DCI had sought to have them detained for 21 days. The Interior Ministry said the suspects failed to comply with conditions stipulated in their tourist visas. “The four were arrested following a report which was made at Kileleshwa police station by Simon Osaka Silo who was an employee of the said restaurant and worked as a waiter," investigator Noah Kiplangat said. Osaka told the police that he was assaulted by Deng Heilan after he reported to work late on February 2. He said Helian later dismissed him for reporting the incident and did not pay him his dues.
