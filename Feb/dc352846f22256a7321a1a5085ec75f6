Immigration services director general Alexander Muteshi has filed a suit at the High Court against Citizen TV after he was adversely mentioned in a land grabbing expose which aired on the station last year. In a notice of motion dated February 3, it is stated that Muteshi has been a civil servant of good standing for 39 years and the expose damaged his reputation. Muteshi has sued Royal Media Services (RMS) - under which Citizen TV is - and investigative reporter Purity Mwambia. The expose which aired in October last year was titled 'Westlands underworld'. It claimed that officials at the Immigration and other government security agencies planned to deport an Indian family so that they can take over the family’s vast wealth. Muteshi has demanded a full, unqualified apology and withdrawal of the publication of the expose from RMS's all social media handles. He also demands damages, costs and the cost of the suit covered. IG Hillary Mutyambai was last year directed to begin investigations into the allegations. In the expose, there was a  well-choreographed plan to deport the  businessman and his sister. The allegations named Deputy Inspector of Police Edward Mbugua, Head of Immigration Services Alex Muteshi, Makadara MP George Aladwa, DCI officers, lawyers among other players. The expose placed the above people at the nerve centre of the plan whose end goal was to deport the family so that they change ownership of the properties owned by Dilip Bakrania and sister Hansa Bakrania.
