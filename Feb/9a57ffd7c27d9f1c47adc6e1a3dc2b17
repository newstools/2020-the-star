Kenya's Ambassador to South Sudan Chris Mburu is dead. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Mburu died on Sunday night after suffering a heart attack. According to the Ministry, the envoy left the country Sunday headed back to Juba before the incident. "For now, all we know is that the envoy suffered a heart attack. We are trying to get finer details and we shall communicate in the due cause," a ministry official said. The ministry said Mburu was in the country after he accompanied President Salvar Kiir for the State funeral of the late former president Daniel Moi. Sources in Juba said Mburu arrived from Nairobi on Sunday but went straight to the hospital because he wasn’t feeling well since morning. According to the source, the sickness didn’t seem serious because he was very stable when he went to the hospital. "Tests indicate high blood pressure, creatinine was high, an indication of a kidney anomaly," the source said.
