The main suspect in the murder of a 75-year-old German national in Malindi last month did not take a plea on Thursday because she had not undergone a psychiatric assessment. Mary Kavuu appeared before Malindi High Court Judge Reuben Nyakundi but prosecutor Barbara Sombo applied for time to take the suspect for mental assessment. Sombo said there is only one doctor who conducts mental tests he is only available on Mondays. She appealed to have the suspect take the text next Monday in Mombasa and return to court on Tuesday. Kavuu was remanded to the Mtangani Maximum Security Prison. It is alleged that on the night of January 27 and 28 at Moriema Cottages in Malindi, Kilifi county, the accused murdered her lover Herman Detering. The state has appointed Enrica Ruto to represent the suspect. Detering's mutilated body was found by workers at the hotel late in the evening after his door remained locked the whole day. the staff went to check his room after he failed to come out in the morning, only to find bloodstains on the window. Moriema Cottages manager Kelly Kazungu said there were deep cuts all over the body. Kazungu said the German rented the hotel for two months from December 4 and paid monthly so most of the time used to have his own keys. He said the day the German is suspected to have been murdered, he drank with his girlfriend till 1am when they retired to bed. Staff said the two were never seen to quarrel and always seemed on good terms. Edited by R.Wamochie
