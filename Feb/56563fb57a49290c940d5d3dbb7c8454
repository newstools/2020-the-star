Kwale county loses about Sh38 million annually on non-revenue water, according to the Water Services Regulatory Board. Wasreb chairperson Joshua Irungu on Thursday said more than half of the water channelled countrywide is lost in mysterious ways. Kenya loses about Sh8 billion. "About 66 per cent of non-revenue water gets lost along the way and we don’t know how," he said. Irungu said that in Kwale, the government and the Coast Water Services Board are investing to produce more water but little reaches the consumers. He said the situation is alarming and requires immediate interventions. Irungu spoke at Biashara House in Msambweni during a stakeholders meeting meant to address constant water problems in the Coast region. He said water companies are not commercially viable because they suffer huge losses caused by water spillage. "Water industries are incapable of sustaining themselves, especially in operation and maintenance, thereby forcing county governments to assist because non-revenue water is draining the economy," Irungu said. The former Laikipia governor said the national government aims to connect water to at least three-quarter of the population by 2022. He said the lost money if accounted for, is able to permanently fix water shortages. He urged governors to work with the national government to fulfil the Big Four agenda. Governor Salim Mvurya said the county has spent a lot of funds on building earth dams and boreholes. He promised to fully support the Coast Water Services Board to ensure residents have water at all times. Two main pumps that supply water at Marere had malfunctioned but engineers are working on it. Mvuryam said water bowsers have been distributed within the county to lessen the crisis. He reminded residents that the money lost over water is through spillage, among other causes, and not in cash.
