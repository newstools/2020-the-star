Matatu operators plying the Kasarani-Mwiki route have threatened another protest over the delayed rehabilitation of the road. They say that the government has failed to fulfil its promise to immediately start off the construction on the road still in a pathetic state. On January 30, the government said it had allocated more than Sh2 billion for the road, following a four-day protest that left one person dead and several injured. Kenya Urban Roads Authority communications boss Stephen Njogu told the Star the delay was caused by the ongoing rainfall. Njogu assured residents that contractors will resume work before the end of the week. “I would like to urge the residents of Kasarani to be patient with us. We cannot forget about them,” he said. The road serves hundreds of thousands of residents living in the constituency. The road has turned into a nightmare for motorists and pedestrians who endure prolonged traffic jams during off-peak hours and rainy season even forcing some residents to move out. Other roads to be upgraded include in the constituency include the Clay City-Thika, Lakisama-Githurai, and Kasarani - Mwiki roads. They have been awarded Sh50 million, Sh1 billion, Sh300 million respectively. Resolutions towards the implementation of the roads include road designs and manpower. Edited by R.Wamochie
