Human rights activist Okiya Omtatah wants Kenya Airways stopped from sending pilot interns to train abroad. In a petition filed at the Constitutional Court in Milimani, Nairobi, Omtatah wants the airline barred from sending candidates to South Africa as per its advert that invited applicants for trainee pilot positions under its Ab Initio Pilot Trainee Programme. The ad closed on December 11, 2019. "I also want the court to certify this matter as urgent and be granted a hearing on a priority basis," Omtatah says. He says KQ has solicited, received and continues to receive public money to keep itself afloat, hence the need to use the money for the benefit of the country.Â  Omtatah says he is aggrieved by KQ's disregard for Kenyan training facilities and Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015. He adds that the national carrier has failed to comply with the Constitution. "By soliciting and receiving public funds, KQ is governed by public law with regard to the necessary safeguard of the said public funds, including being bound by Kenya's public procurement laws," the petition reads. He said Article 10 of the Constitution requires the company to be patriotic and equitable in its operations and initiatives, yet it continues to send its trainee pilots to train outside the country (South Africa), while Kenya has government-approved training organisations. The quality of the Kenyan institutions cannot be faulted because KQ has over the years hired locally trained pilots, and countries in the region train their pilots in Kenya, he adds.
