The requirement for a Muslim woman to indicate whether she is a virgin on her marriage certificate is to be removed. The new marriage certificate is expected to be out in six months. Speaking to the Star int his office on Friday, Chief Kadhi Ahmed Mohdhar said the deletion is due to complaints from the public that the information is insignificant. “Some sections have been removed which the citizens said are unnecessary," Mohdhar said. He said it is "worthless" that others know a woman is a virgin or not. “This is very private and it is not right that other people should know about that. That is someone’s secret. If someone wants to reveal that she is a virgin or not that is no one's concern, it's about someone’s own private life,” the chief Kadhi said. This question is only asked of women, not men. "It discriminates because it’s only based on the woman’s side and it does not ask if the prospective husband is a virgin or not,” he said. Seeking comments on the streets of Mombasa, the Star learned that many people are glad the section will be removed. Ismail Zema who is already married and has a marriage certificate said 95 per cent of people in the world get married while they have already tasted the "forbidden fruit." He said asking such a question is not useful. “If she is a virgin, then only the couples should have the knowledge of that and not anybody else. The certificate is only a paper but evidence is only between couples,” Zema said. Warda Noor said in this era people have sex when they are as young as 15 years, so it's quite difficult to find virgins. The section should be removed." Maridhia Mwinyi said it's no one's business. “That question is not right, it does not concern anyone. Asking a woman if she is a virgin is like throwing insults at her, what do you want with her virginity? Leave that question to that person who will marry her,” Mwinyi said. The new marriage certificate will also be reduced in size from A3 to A4. (Edited by V. Graham)
