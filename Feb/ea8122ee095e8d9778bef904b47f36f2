Hate speech and incitement to violence charges against former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and Makadara MP George Alawa have been dropped. They were dismissed on grounds of unconstitutionality. A Milimani law court, citing a High Court ruling, said on Tuesday the basis of the charges were unconstitutional because they required the defendant to provide his or her innocence —not the state to prove his or her guilt. The burden of proof must rest with the state, it said. Presiding magistrate Francis Andayi on Tuesday said his decision was bound by the decision of the High Court that declared section 96A of the Penal Code unconstitutional. “I hereby dismiss the charges against the accused persons and thus the case is terminated,” Andayi said. On Monday, the Director of Public Prosecutions urged the Nairobi court to withdraw the cases against Muthama and Aladwa. This is after the High Court barred the DPP from charging Muthama with incitement to violence over the 2015 incident. Justices Jessie Lesiit, Luka Kimaru and John Mativo declared the section unconstitutional as it shifts the legal and evidential burden of proof to the accused. The judges said the section is not only in conflict with Article 50 of the Constitution but also offends the common law in that “it is always for the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused and that the proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt." That judgment was delivered on January 29. Muthama was harged alongside activist Japheth Muroko, popularly known as Japheth Thuranira. They were out on Sh100,000 bail each. The charges against Muroko were also dropped. Aladwawas accused of making hate speech remarks in Kibera on Mashujaa Day in 2015. Court papers said that Muthama said in Swahili at Uhuru Park on September 23, 2015, that teachers must be paid and if they are not paid no will go to work and strikebreakers will be stoned.
