Harambee Starlets’ forward Essie Mbeyu Akida has signed a two-year deal with Turkish side, Besiktas. Akida becomes the second female payer to play for a top European club after another Kenyan Doreen Nabwire who played for Warder Bremen from 2009. However, she becomes the first East African female player to play for a team featuring in the Champions League and will be the only African in the current Besiktas squad. Besiktas J.K play in the women’s Premier League in Turkey and are currently featuring in Uefa women’s Champions’ League, where they are second on the log. The former Thika Queens player has penned a deal from FC Ramat Hasharon in Israel which she joined in 2018. The versatile offensive player was part of the team that qualified for the 2016 women’s Africa Cup of Nations and is Harambee Starlets all-time top scorer with 15 goals. She has 36 caps for the national team. In the Kenya Women Premier League, the 27-year-old featured for the recently relegated Spedag FC and Thika Queens. Sara Ogonya, her former coach at Spedag FC was elated following the move. “I am happy for her and that is definitely a good move and especially for the profile of women’s football in Kenya. She will put us on the world map and open ways for more Kenyan female players.” Akida is also a Business Management graduate from Methodist University. She becomes one of the many Harambee Starlets players to sign professional contracts abroad with her counterpart Corazone Aquino having recently signed a deal with Portuguese side Atletico Ourense. Other Kenyans are defender Ruth Ingosi and goalkeeper Annet Kundu who are currently playing in Cyprus.
