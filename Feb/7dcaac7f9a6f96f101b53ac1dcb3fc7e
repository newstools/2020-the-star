Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen on Saturday asked proponents of the Building Bridges Initiative to stop political conmanship and respect DP William Ruto. In an apparent reference to ODM leader Raila Odinga, Murkomen said for genuine unity of the country, people should first accept that President Uhuru Kenyatta won the 2017 election. “If you want to organise BBI rallies that are transparent we must accept Mt Kenya and other parts of the country overwhelmingly voted for Uhuru and Ruto,” he said. Speaking during the sixth BBI mobilisation and sensitisation rally at Kinoru Stadium in Meru – an event presided over by Raila – Murkomen said political conmanship was to blame for the problems and division in the country. The Senate Majority leader said BBI supporters should stop lying to Kenyans that the initiative will solve myriads of problems Kenyans face. “The biggest problem in Kenyan politics is political conmanship. If we want to unite Kenya, we must stop conmanship." Murkomen further asked the leaders to respect the DP, Jubilee party and the leadership of the President Uhuru Kenyatta. “I am happy that those abuses you have been hurling at the DP have not been brought to this rally. Those saying we should respect the President should respect his party and his deputy." He asked BBI supporters to use resources at their disposal to change the fortunes of their electorate.
