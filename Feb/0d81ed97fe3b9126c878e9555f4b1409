Deputy President William Ruto has eulogised the late and retired President Daniel Moi As the professor of politics in Kenya, despite his not possessing a PhD. "Without a PhD, Moi became a professor... a professor in the school of politics. His mission was siasa mbaya, maisha mbaya (bad politics, bad life) and vision was peace, love and unity. Most leaders here today are graduates of that school, including myself," he said. Ruto spoke on Tuesday at Nyayo Stadium, during the funeral service for Mzee Moi. The DP also acknowledged Moi as being a unifying factor who brought together all tribes, include small communities. "Moi stood out when he took over from Jomo Kenyatta and brought on board tirelessly all communities to the mainstream," he said. Speaking about his relationship with Moi, Ruto said he was genuine. "President Moi being human was not perfect, but as a person very close to him in his last three years ofÂ  his presidency, I can say without contradiction that he was genuine and he did his best. That we can attest," Ruto said. The DP eulogised Moi as a patriot and a nationalist and strong believer in God.
