Huawei has denied having backdoor access to telcom networks. In a statement on Wednesday, the firm said, "US allegations of Huawei using lawful interception are nothing but a smokescreen – they don't adhere to any form of accepted logic in the cyber security domain. Huawei has never and will never covertly access telecom networks, nor do we have the capability to do so." The firm was reacting to an article by the Wall Street Journal stating Huawei can covertly access telcom networks and has the capability for close to a decade. However, Huawei instead accused the US of "covertly accessing telecom networks worldwide, spying on other countries for quite some time". US President Donald Trump's administration has spent the past year trying to pressure its allies to prevent Huawei from building their next-generation wireless networks.
