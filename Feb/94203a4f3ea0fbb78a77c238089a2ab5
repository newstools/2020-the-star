The Kenya National Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Mombasa chapter, on Thursday hosted the Bangladesh-Kenya Business Forum at the English Point Marina. The forum, which was attended by the Mombasa Business Community, was graced by Bangladeshi High Commissioner Maj General (Rtd) Jahangir Talukder. The High Commissioner asked the Kenyan business community to invest in onions, cotton, timber and flower sectors, which are on demand in Bangladesh, a country of 170 million people. He said they are forced to import these commodities due to high demand back in their country. Others in attendance included KNNCI Mombasa CEO James Kitavi.
