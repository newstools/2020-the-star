President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence the family, friends and relatives of businessman Lawrence Nginyo Kariuki. Kariuki passed away on Monday morning at a Nairobi hospital. In his message, Uhuru described the late Kariuki as an astute businessman and serial entrepreneur whose businesses created thousands of jobs for young Kenyans. “Kenya has lost a great patriot and a business icon who believed in the Kenyan market. As an entrepreneur, Kariuki's businesses created thousands of jobs for our youth," he said. Besides his business exploits, Uhuru underscored the late Kariuki's outstanding support for institutions and initiatives aimed at uplifting the country's socioeconomic wellbeing. The Head of State prayed to God to give the family of the late Nginyo Kariuki the fortitude to bear the loss and assured them of his support at this difficult period of mourning. Nginyo was also the founder member of The National Alliance Party (TNA) and Jubilee party spokesperson in Kiambu county. In August 2019, the multi-party democracy crusader presented his views to the Building Bridges Initiative.
