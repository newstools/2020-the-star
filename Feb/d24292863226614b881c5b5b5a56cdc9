Students from poor families in Saku constituency, Marsabit, will benefit from Sh36 million bursary cash. MP Dido Raso launched the bursary fund at Moi Girls Secondary School in Marsabit on Sunday. The money will support students in secondary schools, tertiary institutions, and universities. This year's kitty increased by Sh9 million from last year's Sh27 million. Of the Sh36 million, Sh21 million was allocated for secondary school students, while Sh15 million will benefit college and university students. CDF chairman Guyo Bonaya said the selection of the beneficiaries was done above board and no needy student was left out. Raso said bursary programmes should be harmonised to eliminate duplication. "Proper structures are needed to ensure coordination and regulation of all scholarship program," he said. MP Raso said most schools in his constituency are grappling with congestion as the government implements a 100 per cent transition policy. He said although the aim is to give every child an education, the focus should now shift to the improvement of infrastructure. The MP further warned parents against denying their children their right to education, calling on them to pay extra attention to their children's education.
