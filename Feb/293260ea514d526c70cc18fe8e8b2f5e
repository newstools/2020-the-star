Butali Warriors will miss the services of experienced forward Frank Wanangwe for the start of the season due to work-related commitment. The pacy forward got greener pastures in the United States and even though he is registered with the club this season, it is unclear when he will return. Wanagwe missed the second leg last season and was tipped to make a comeback from the knee injury that kept him out since September. The former Strathmore Gladiators player was the hero when his brace helped the sugar millers beat rivals Kenya Police to win the 2018 title on the ultimate day. It is a familiar scenario for the four-time Premier League champions, having missed the services of the veteran attacker Zack Aura for the better part of last season under similar circumstances. The former Kenya International has been handed a coaching role at the club now. Captain Kennedy Nyongesa acknowledged that it is a big loss for the club but called on the new boys and the old guards to work towards filling that void. "As a team, we will surely miss his contribution. His chances to play at the start of the season are slim. We were optimistic that he will help us later,"said Nyongesa. "We wish him well in his endeavors because he has demonstrated professionalism on and off the field. He's always welcome whenever available," said the solid defender. Vincent Onyango and Moses Ademba have played in Wanangwe's role before. Meanwhile, Nyongesa has challenged the playing unit to maintain consistency and resilience ahead of the new season. The Warriors won the league unbeaten and the captain thinks the team will not be denied a fifth premier league title should they remain solid. "We face a difficult task of defending our title because our opponents will want to prove a point against us. However, we are prepared for the Herculean task," said Nyongesa. "The team structure and the way we play will surely give us an upper hand. The new players have given us hope of a better season."
