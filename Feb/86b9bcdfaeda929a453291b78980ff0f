Leaders in Kwale county have come to the defense of Base Titanium over accusations that the company is exploiting residents. Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori on Sunday said some Kwale politicians had been misleading residents over mining rights. Dori said some politicians were going around the county accusing Base Titanium, an Australian mining company, of exploiting the locals who do not get anything in return. “There are people moving around saying that Kwale residents do not want minerals. Yet we all know that we have been benefiting from the mining activities. Have they consulted you?” Dori said. He said Base Titanium had transformed the lives of many of Kwale residents in terms of health, education and job opportunities. “There are people who are hellbent on frustrating investors in the region. They only want to paralyse the economy of our county by ensuring that mining activities do not happen,” he said. The MP spoke during the issuance of bursaries to over 900 Form 1 students in Gasi. Mshenga Ruga, the board chairman of Coast Development Authority, said Base Titanium had helped sponsor many students within the county. “Leaders in the region need to research on the work of multi-national companies like Base Titanium,” Ruga said. He supported Dori’s initiative in coming up with projects for the locals. Former Kinondo MCA Juma Maone challenged parents to take advantage of the bursaries given by both Base Titanium and MP Dori to educate children. Dori commended the efforts by ODM leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta in uniting Kenya. He said the coming together of the two leaders was the wisest decision they have ever made, adding that the Kenya was bigger than individuals. He however faulted people close to Uhuru and Odinga who have politicised the Building the Bridges Initiative.
