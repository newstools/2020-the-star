 Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has asked Kenyans to pray for the government in its fight against corruption. Speaking in Limuru on Saturday, Wamatangi said some individuals implicated in graft were strong and powerful and often defend themselves before their supporters claiming the charges were political. He said politics and corruption are different issues and that no one can be falsely accused of graft. He praised MCA's for the oversight role they are playing to question how funds disbursed to their counties are being used. "We at the Senate are happy with how our MCA's are doing at their work. We urge them not to relent. Everyone must come in and pray for our government as it embarks on cleansing itself," Wamatangi said. He said the war on corruption will not stop until all greedy leaders are wiped out of public offices and charged. The senator urged elected leaders to work hard for their people to improve their living standards. Governors Moses Lenolkulal (Samburu) and Mike Sonko (Nairobi) are facing different charges of corruption. They have since been barred from accessing their offices. Former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu was charged with graft and consequently impeached by MCAs. The Senate last month upheld the impeachment and Waititu was hounded out of office. His deputy James Nyoro has since been sworn in as the new Kiambu governor. Wamatangi urged Nyoro to ensure stalled projects are completed. The legislator said the county government has been staggering since corruption allegation cases started haunting Waititu. He said projects such as roads, water and hospitals which impacts on people's everyday lives stalled eliciting complaints from residents. The senator advised Nyoro to reorganise the government. Limuru resident James Njenga also asked Nyoro to restructure his cabinet, saying those appointed by Waititu might not be comfortable working with him given the fallout he had with his predecessor.  edited by Peter obuya
