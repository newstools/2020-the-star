The country is falling so fast into the pit of corruption at the watch of the Judiciary whose efforts are not up to speed to save the nation from this dreadful impasse. As much as several 'Big Fish' have been arrested for a few days and have cases dragging in court, as long as no one is convicted, corruption wins. Perhaps we are missing something about how investigations are carried out but it can be believable that the longer it takes, the more the time the defendant has to influence the evidence. How long will it take to close former Nairobi Evans Kidero's graft case? The same for the current one Mike Sonko and Samburu's Moses Lenolkulal's? We can only wait long enough until we believe in their absolute innocence or forget their cases. The Judiciary must expedite investigations to reduce the numerous backlog and give little time for the accused persons to manipulate evidence.  Via E-Mail
