The feuds over the control of Nairobi's Finance department have intensified. Confusion emerged over who is substantively in charge after Sonko claimed to have degazetted Pauline Kahiga and replaced her with Allan Igambi who heads the Trade department. However, Government Printer CEO Mwenda Njoka dismissed the changes saying the degazettement was not done as per the law. On January 30, 2020, Sonko made changes in his cabinet, sacking Kahiga. For almost a month, neither Kahiga nor Igambi has been at the Finance office, leaving staff frustrated and confused about who they should be reporting to. The county assembly has maintained that Kahiga is the substantive holder of the office, despite Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto ruling on Friday that Sonko did not break any law by reshuffling his cabinet. "In the circumstances, it is our considered opinion that as the law currently stands, there is no legal basis for the Government Printer’s decision not to effect the above-mentioned gazettement as requested by the county government," Ogeto said. The Government Printer declined to gazette Igambi as the new executive and sought the Attorney General's advisory opinion. Pronouncing herself on the issue, assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi on Tuesday said Kahiga remains the substantive executive until Sonko tables documents confirming the changes. "We are not going to allow you to interdict and you have not given us the nature of what is going on. Until this House resolves otherwise, the CEC Finance of Nairobi county remains Pauline Kahiga," she said. "Until you unveil the new CEC by following the laid-down procedure, gazette and table all the documents before the assembly, and assure us things will continue working properly, Ms Kahiga is still in office." Elachi said the assembly must be satisfied through evidence that the governor followed the law. Otherwise, no writing will be done to the Controller of Budget, the Central Bank and the National Treasury.
