President Uhuru Kenyatta has said the US can learn a lot from the Building Bridges Initiative. Uhuru on Wednesday said the BBI model is a unique one that should be adopted internationally. Speaking at the Atlantic Council Forum in the US on Wednesday, Uhuru said the model provides a unique ground on how international communities make their judgement about politics not only in Kenya but across the African continent. He said the initiative is a key pillar to the political and social governance engineering. “This is a homegrown solution for a divisive political culture that has bred conflicts. It is the best way to preempt further escalation in political competition,” Uhuru said. He added that the other goals of the BBI were to strengthen the center through inclusivity and deliver bold reforms that also enhance economic growth. Uhuru explained that the country had decided to ensure that the country's social contract fits the political circumstances of the country. "We have realised that first-past-the-post form of election competition is not sustainable for our country," Uhuru said. The President said that Kenya was fixing its socio-political structure as a platfotom for sustainable economic development. Uhuru said when he resolved to unite with ODM leader Raila Odinga for this initiative only a few believed it was possible. “We are focusing on using inclusivity to strengthen the centre of politics. We want a country where leaders can have the willingness to compromise to disorient politics of extremism,” he said. “This initiative further looks at bold reforms that advance inclusion, eliminate corruption. I there ask you as a council to delve deeper into the initiative,” he added. Uhuru said so far other countries are seeking to learn from Kenya and as a government they  have been open to sharing. “I dare you to imagine and support African driven solution. Resist from being drawn into proxy struggle with other states and support Africa,” Uhuru said.
