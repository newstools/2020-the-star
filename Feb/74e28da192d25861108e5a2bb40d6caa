Embu county government has, in collaboration with the Kenya Forest Service, trained tour guides and porters for tourism exploits in Mt Kenya East circuit. The 20 youths will act as guides for domestic and foreign tourists. The county has set aside funds to open a route to the mountain through Irangi Forest. The youth, trained by the Trade department, will be hired by the county and tour companies to market tourist and scenic sites in the Mt Kenya circuit. Trade CEC Jamleck Muturi called on the youth to be at the forefront of marketing tourist attractions. "The main (Mt Kenya) peaks – Lenana and Batian – are more visible from this new route and so you will be engaged positively,” Muturi said. The CEC said the youth will also sensitise local communities on cultural and agricultural tourism. "The youth will mostly be based at the entrance of Irangi Forest where they will be picking up tourists to guide." He disclosed that the world is now focusing on community-based tourism because of its high sustainability. Muturi said, “Tourists will, in addition to mountain-climbing, be able to engage in sport fishing, nature walks and bird watching as well as visiting Mau Mau caves,” he said. Mt Kenya deputy park warden George Ombuki encouraged the youth to take the knowledge learned as a business opportunity to grow themselves. Ombuki, who is also the mountain search officer at Mt Kenya National Park, said the youth will also be trained on wilderness first aid skills. "This is because they will be the first line of defence with tourists and hence these skills are important for the safety of guests," Ombuki said. Edited by R.Wamochie
