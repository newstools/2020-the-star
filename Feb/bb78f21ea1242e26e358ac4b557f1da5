The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has condemned the remarks made by Narok Senator Ledama Olekina which he made on Wednesday on national television. During an interview in JKL on Wednesday night, the senator said the upcoming Building Bridges Initiative rally in Narok will be about the Maa community. Olekina had said two groups held meetings separately to articulate on issues to be addressed during the rally. "In the morning, those who are non-Maasai held a meeting in Rongai. We held our meeting at the Maasai Lodge. We were there to articulate on our issues," Olekina said. "Maasai issues will be better articulated by Maasais and am not going to apologise for that." The senator further said that the meeting will only address issues affecting the entire Maa counties, which he alleged have been 'terrorised and stigmatised' for a long time. Olekina was responding to his counterpart from Kericho County Aaron Cheruiyot who said a non-Maasai leader was barred from the meeting. Senator Cheruiyot protested the exclusion saying that all the communities residing in the region should be included. Olekina said part of the proposals to be submitted to the BBI team on Saturday includes the reservation of Maasai land. "Maasai land should be reserved for the Maasai land and food security," Olekina said. Ole Kina's comments caught the attention of Kenyans on social media who condemned him for being tribal. NCIC has also asked Kenyans to maintain peace and to continue engaging in the BBI process even as it continues looking into the matter. Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen also condemned his remarks. However, Olekina maintained his stand and dismissed those who accused for being tribal.
