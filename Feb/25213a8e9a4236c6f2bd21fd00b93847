The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority has raised alarm over impostors who are obtaining money from innocent Kenyans under the guise of licensed fuel dealers. The impostors are pretending to be the staff from the authority claiming they are able to process licenses for them as well as reinstating the suspended ones. "The fraudsters are asking the licensees to send them money in exchange for quick processing of license applications and reinstatement of purportedly suspended licenses," the EPRA statement reads. The authority has stated that its license application fees are payable through the authorised bank accounts and the provided M-Pesa bill number and not through individuals. It has further asked for vigilance and for people to verify their license status via the authority's online portal. The licensees can also verify if an individual claiming to be an employee from the authority by asking for their ID numbers. To know if the employee is a genuine EPRA staff, you send the ID number to 40850 and you will receive the details about the person. Suspected fraudsters can be reported at the nearby police stations or by dialling the authority's hotline number. Large and medium industries had until December 31, 2019, to comply with the new rules that require them to conduct energy use audits every three years. An energy audit is an inspection, survey and analysis of energy flow for energy conservation in a building, process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output. The audits must be conducted using Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) approved auditors and the results filed with the regulator.
