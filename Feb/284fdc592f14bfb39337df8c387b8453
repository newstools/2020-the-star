A man was hospitalised after he was shot with two arrows over a land dispute in Tiloi village in Ossen, Baringo North subcounty, on Friday. Wilson Sumukwo, 64, was rushed to Baringo Referral Hospital with the arrows lodged in his back and waist. “We managed to stabilise his condition before referring him to Nakuru General Hospital for specialised treatment,” hospital superintendent Ben Chepkong'a said on Sunday. Chepkong’a said the doctors in the facility’s theatre were unable to remove the arrow stuck in his body. “On his way to hospital, the victim managed to brave the pain to pull out one arrow on his own, but the hooked one remained lodged in his back,”  resident, Silas Komen, said. Komen said it was around 1pm when the scuffle over disputed land erupted between the old man and 22-year-old suspect Toroitich Ruto. “Then the charged youth rushed to his home to arm himself with arrows and rushed back to attack Sumukwo who was then busy attending to the contentious farm,” he said. The incident happened a day after a 58-year old man from Chapin village in Bartabwa ward was shot dead by a young man during a scuffle in a local brew den. Tiloi sub-location assistant chief Musa Toroitich said he got information Sumukwo was busy felling trees using a power saw before the sudden arrow attack. “For now, I am not in a position to give more details because the whole issue is with the police,” Toroitch said. But Mathew Sumukwo, a son of the victim, blamed land surveyors together with the area chiefs for taking too long to resolve the land disputes. Two clans, Kapchepkorei -the natives - and Kamingo from Kerio are battling over demarcation. Baringo North police commander Fredrick Odinga said the suspect who fled after the attack was still at large. “Our officers have managed to arrest the suspect of the previous fatal arrow attack in Chapin Bartabwa, but we are on course to pursue and apprehend the suspect behind this other attack in Ossen,” Odinga said.
