Digitising postal services in Kenya is key to driving the growth of e-commerce in the country, postmaster general Daniel Kagwe has said. “Having a technologically different postal service will grow e-commerce in the country and hence boost the economy,” Kagwe said. He spoke during 20th-anniversary commemoration of the corporation. Through partnerships such as the M-post service where the firm partnered with Safaricom to roll out digital boxes, Posta identified the importance of using technology in the digital world. “The postal industry has been going through changes as a result of rapid technological advances, innovations and steady growth in e-commerce. “It is clear that the challenges brought about by the ever-evolving technology, at the formative period of postal business are more of a threat than an opportunity,” Kagwe said. The postal service company yesterday unveiled a commemoration stamp to mark the anniversary. The stamp marks the 20 years of operations as Postal Corporation of Kenya and features the iconic Posta House building next to the General Post Office. A report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ranks  Kenya seventh in Africa in e-commerce uptake and 85th globally.
