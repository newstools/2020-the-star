Wasafi star Mbosso says his 2020 has started badly after losing one of his biggest fans from Mombasa. The fan, Mzee Jamal, 61, died last week. The two met when Mbosso visited Mombasa back in 2017, and Mbosso has been helping Mzee Jamal through his medication. Speaking to Word Is, he said he did not expect to get such news. "It is too soon but it is by God’s will, we cannot avoid it,” he said. Mbosso described the bond as strong in such a way that he considered him as a parent. “I loved him and he loved me back. He was funny and he was a man of the people,” he said. The two met through social media and connected when Mbosso came to Kenya to perform and even went on stage with him when performing. Mbosso did not attend the burial because of his schedule, but he plans to come to Kenya and conduct special prayers for him in March this year.
