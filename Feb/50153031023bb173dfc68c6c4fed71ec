Dr. Lieve Lynen is not only my wife, but also a veterinarian-colleague, and a fine field researcher. In 1998, when she introduced the East Coast fever (ECF) vaccine to Tanzania, the Maasai Community called her “Mama Ndigana Kali” and regarded her as one their goddesses. In fact, while the ECF vaccine gives a protection of 98%, the disease, a cattle tick-borne one, gives up to 80% mortality. Only in 2013, in North-East Tanzania, mainly through the efforts of Lieve, 130,000 calves were vaccinated against ECF and survived the disease. The Maasai Community still say:  “Gods gave us the ECF vaccine, and only Gods can take it out from us.” Lieve fought for “improving the livelihoods of millions of livestock owners” through the ECF vaccine use. In the livestock owners’ interest, Lieve always shared her knowledge and experience with anybody, wanting to provide greater access to the ECF vaccine for the livestock owners. Unfortunately, since 2013, in spite of her efforts, fewer and fewer calves have been vaccinated in Tanzania. And, regrettably, in 2017, Lieve stopped the ECF vaccinations because the Maasai Community reported the vaccine not to work very well. Again and unfortunately, some organizations took advantage of her achievements without acknowledging them. This was done to attract donors funds. Appallingly, some of these organizations refused giving  the news of her death by using their media.
