Racing crews believe the introduction of a power stage will add more zest to this weekend’s KCB Guru Nanak Rally slated for Stony Athi on Sunday. Mombasa-based rally navigator Victor Okundi said the power stage will enhance competiton and indeed give spectators extra fun. “I’ve not had time to go through the National Competition Rules but if it is in line with the WRC, it’s a welcome opportunity to score points and make it more competitive. Therefore, one would just have to fight to be in the top 10 then fight tooth and nail for the top 3 slots for extra points. Not a bad idea,” said Okundi. Group ‘N’ champion and Premier Class driver Jasmeet Chana is excited that the power stage is being introduced in a year Kenya is rejoining the WRC. “It couldn’t have come at a better time when Kenya is preparing for global status. Being a key ingredient of the WRC competition, it will see drivers give it that extra push for points,” Chana said. Power stages have over the years been synonymous with World Rally Championship events. They are usually run as a final stage of a rally in the WRC with top five crews through the stage scoring additional points. This is regardless of where they are classified in a rally. Locally, power stages have been few and far between and devoid of bonus points. But following the timely addition to the NCRs, crews will now be privileged to score bonus points following the running of the power-stage. Raju Chaggar, who is the clerk for season-opening  Guru Nanak Rally, recently nominated the repeat run of the SGR section as the power stage; where spectators will be treated to some hair-raising cockpit thrills. Guru Nanak, one of the most prestigious rounds of the eight-leg Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC), will be flagged off from KCB Kitengela Branch then head straight to SGR, Stoni Athi and Kifaru regions for action proper.
