Kisii traders have complained that low customer numbers and high commodity prices are driving them out of business. Those servicing loans say banks are knocking on their doors as the rates of default rise, while others have had their property auctioned by lenders. Many of the proprietors have laid off staff as hard times bite, says Silicon Restaurant owner John Omiti. “It isn't rosy, the forecast remains grim. From the 300 customers a day we used to serve here, we now do with less than 60," Omiti said. High-end salon owners are also lamenting low customer numbers. They say many of their clients have now shifted to the roadside barbers and salons. Beatrice Kerubo, who operates two beauty outlets in Kisii said her businesses could be auctioned if she fails to service her Sh3 million bank loan. At Ogembo, Bomachoge Chache subcounty, second-hand clothes dealer Mary Moracha says the current situation is bad for business. “I bought two bundles of clothes in September but the stock is still huge,” she said. John Osito, a butcher at Nyangusu blamed the government for the hard economic times. “We elected fools to every high office in the country. They are only thinking of how they can perpetuate dynasties and their hold on power,” he said. Osito said their suffering will persist as long the country elects idiots into office. “I expect little, if any, from our political leaders. They will keep coming up with all manner of dirty political games to buy time in power as we suffer,” Osito said. In Masimba, matatu owner James Momanyi urged the country to lower taxes. Momanyi said high taxes were a burden on struggling Kenyans, many of whom are too poor to afford a decent meal.
