Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru wants the posts of deputy president and deputy prime minister be reserved for a woman. Waiguru maintains that the alternative gender form of leadership that was proposed in the initial BBI report should not be removed. “We need more seats at the top (the executive) including a prime minister and two deputies. If the president is male, then the deputy president should be female. One of the deputy prime ministers should also be female,” Waiguru said. The first time governor, speaking during the Narok BBI forum on Saturday at the Narok Stadium (now renamed Ole Ntimama Stadium), also sought to clarify that the clamour for gender equality is not a gender war between men and women. “We need more women at the top because they understand the issues that affect women. We have maternal health and children health as some of the issues that affect women,” Waiguru said. Stating that she was among the first politicians to support the handshake, Waiguru said that expansion of the executive will prevent a situation where two large communities occupy power at the expense of others. In November last year, women leaders demanded that all registered political parties nominate at least one-third of women to run for elective posts. The women were responding to the recommendations of the Justice, Legal Affairs, and Human Rights Committee to reject a proposed constitutional amendment to give effect to the two-thirds gender rule. They added there may be a need to find another way to achieve the principle without nominations and two thirds can be realized if women, the largest segment of the population, were cooperative.
