Emurrua Dikiri MP Johana Ngeno has been arrested. The MP was arrested along two Members of County Assembly with police saying they were conducting parallel BBI consultative forums. The MCAs are Jefferson Langat- Ololulunga Ward and Stanley Langat - Ilkerin ward. The three are being held at the Ololulunga police station. According to police, they were tipped that the three were having a meeting in the form of BBI forum at the Kimogoro sub-county in Narok. Police are however yet to clarify why the legislators were arrested. On Friday Jefferson Langat with Narok Deputy GovernorÂ  Evalyn Arusa walked out of a BBI consultative forum at the Masaai University claiming ethnic profiling. Last year Ngeno and Jefferson were arrested on their way to Maasai Mau to lead protests against the second phase of Mau Forest evictions. The MP was stopped at a roadblock at Olmekenyu in Narok South and told to go back. He declined and was consequently arrested. The duo was taken to Narok Police Station to record statements.
