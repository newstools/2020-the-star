Madrasa teachers have been urged to stick to their curriculum. Speaking in Garissa town during a career progression meeting, Dr Abdiaziz Ali Ahmed, a lecturer at Mustaqbal University said some teacher have corrupted the minds of their students by teaching wrong things. The government has in the past cracked down on the duksis and Madrasas, arresting some teachers on suspicion of radicalising children. Ahmed said it was morally wrong for a teacher to teach young ones outside what the Quran provides. He urged parents to take their children to Madrasas that are registered and have reputation. The integration of Duksi and Madarasa into the mainstream education, currently underway, will boost enrolment in schools, he said. He said the harmonization of the Islamic and mainstream education system would help children attend classes and continue with their Quran lessons at young age. “The Islamic Madrassa education system is holistic, comprehensive and imparts lifelong skills and attitudes that offer opportunities to current global challenges including unprecedented peace. Any education system is to  ensure national cohesion, fulfilment of individuals and cultural aspirations among others,” he said.
