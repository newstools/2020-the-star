Wolverines' new signing Pauline Ochieng is relishing the challenge of playing in the women's Hockey Premier League. The athletic central midfielder was signed from the Super League side University of Nairobi last month. She was the Most Valuable Player in the Kenya Hockey Union league last year. The former Amira Sailors player also won the hockeyKE women's Super League Player of the year award on February 1. Ochieng also bagged the most promising player in the Parklands tournament early this month and she is determined to take her accolades to the next level.\The 24-year old has asked her team-mates not to play under pressure if they are to prove the doubting Thomases wrong. "I have zero pressure. I am anxious and ready for the top tier experience which I believe will be massive. There's nothing new only that I get to play with better hockey and experienced players,"Â  Ochieng said. She added: "The team must play to enjoy the game. We need to be bold with our ball-handling and decision making. It is what I have learnt in the short stint I have been in the game and without a doubt, it was the reason why I have won a number of awards," a bold Ochieng said. Having played in the second tier for three seasons, the Urban planning degree holder wanted a new challenge. "I am trying to fit into the new system. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone at UON and try something new. The time was ripe and the chance was hard to turn down. We can do better as a team," she said.
