After completion of the mapping of the course earlier in the year, Kenyan organisers will today present to the World Rally Championship (WRC) manufacturers a detailed route itinerary of Safari Rally. The presentation that will be executed by KMSF Chairman Phineas Kimathi will coincide with this week's WRC Rally of Sweden which is the only all-snow event on the global circuit. Kimathi, who is also the CEO of Kasarani-based WRC Safari Project, said they have a number of timelines ahead of the event slated for July. "I will be presenting the route to manufacturers this week in Sweden which is supposed to come five months prior to the event. On January 30, we presented the same to the FIA and WRC Promoter," said Kimathi who jetted out to Sweden on Monday. Kenyan organisers have a number of deadlines to meet. Among them is the publishing of the officialÂ  Rally Guide on the event website. The Draft Safety Plan is to be released before April 15 and so will be Regulations. Supplementary Regulations will be published on May 15, the same time the international entries will open. The 2020 FIA World Rally Championship is the 48th season of the World Rally Championship, an auto racing competition recognised by FIA as the highest class of international rallying. Teams and crews are due to compete in 14 legs of the World Rally Championships for Drivers, Co-drivers and Manufacturers. Crews are free to compete in cars complying with World Rally Car and Group R regulations. However, only manufacturers competing with World Rally cars homologated under regulations introduced in 2017, are eligible to score points in the Manufacturers' championship. The championship began in January with the Rallye Monte Carlo and conclude in November 2020 with Rally Japan.
