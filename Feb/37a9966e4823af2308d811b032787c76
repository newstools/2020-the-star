 Mwache Dam is being redesigned without public involvement, Kinango MP Benjamin Tayari said at the weekend. Tayari said the constituents are wondering why some areas are being included yet they were not gazetted as being part of the Fulugani-based project, which already has attracted controversy. Residents cite land injustices and unfairness in compensation. The project was scheduled to start in June last year but there is nothing on the ground. On compensation, the locals say that the amount per acre has been reduced to Sh300,000 instead of Sh10 million earlier promised. Spokesman Shaban Ndegwa said nothing has been forthcoming after they submitted their demands through the Mwache Dam committee to the national government. Ndegwa, who spoke on Saturday at Fulugani in Kinango, said some officials have been threatening to evict them if they are not agreeable to their terms. He said some Mwache Dam officials had resorted to the divide and rule policy and in the process causing mistrust among communities. Ndegwa, like Tayari, said the project was being redesigned such that some areas mapped out for compensation have been omitted. He said people are now supposed to vacate areas like Kitanga Juu, Kadzandani and Vunga. Tayari said the county government has not been involved in compensation. Last week, the National Land Commission, through Kazungu Kambi, said all land injustices would be addressed to ensure just and fair compensation. Kambi called for calm as the NLC and the national government sort out the matter.
