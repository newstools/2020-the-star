Our African leaders should stop hiding their illnesses. There's no need to hide or shy away from the public eye. If we look aged and stone-faced, that's normal because no one is made to be forever young. Don't sit in dark rooms or draw curtains to avoid being seen by the public because you're growing old or are ill. We all get sick at one point in life. We just live only one life. Do not ask the media to switch off their cameras at public functions thinking people will judge you for having some sort of illness. We will not think you are weak for being illâ€“no one is. If it gets to such an extent, it is better to excuse yourself citing your health status and not attend at all. The public will always speculate and hiding it will not stop the rumours. The well-wishers among them will pray for the leader's health as that is all they can do.  Mombasa
