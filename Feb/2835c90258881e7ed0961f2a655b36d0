This Valentine's Day, Sauti Za Mabinti have a special edition under the theme 'The Love Language', with different musicians using their talent to express love through arts and music. This edition is special because they will not only have the ladies performing but also have a male guest who has a 'love language' set. The line-up includes Zaituni Wambui, a female singer-songwriter and a live performing artiste based in Nairobi, Kenya, doing urban taarab. She will be joined by New York ritual performance artiste Kelly Greenlight, a freedom lover, wellness worker and international cultural organiser. Others include Zippie Nyumu and Carolyn Njeri, who will be the host for the evening.
