More than 3,000 squatters living in the disputed Mwatate Sisal Estate at Singila and the Majengo estates in Mwatate subcounty will be settled, Governor Granton Samboja has revealed. Samboja said on Monday the government is processing more than 1,500 new titles to be issued. He said the government aims to complete the survey and demarcation of the Singila and Majengo estates in 90 days to pave way for issuance of title deeds. He was speaking at his Mwatate office during a meeting with leaders from Singila and Majengo. He revealed that the Maungu and Miasenyi settlement areas will be surveyed and title deeds issued by June this year “We are collaborating with the National Government in facilitating the Sh1.2 million exercise,” Samboja said. The governor said the resolution to the long-standing land dispute follows an agreement with the landowner to surrender a section of his sisal land to settle the squatters. In 2016, the Teita Sisal Estate hived off over 200 acres from its vast sisal plantation to settle some squatters in Singila-Majengo in an agreement with the county. The agreement signed by the estate manager Philip Keriazzy will reduce the number of landless people in the region. The group has claimed the sisal estate encroached onto their ancestral land. However, a section of squatters under the Mwasima Mbuwa Welfare Association has opposed settlement in that part of the estate. They want Teita Estate to surrender more than 33,000 acres, which they claim was encroached upon0 years ago. The welfare association has been under sharp criticism from leaders for harbouring self-interests in their fight for land rights. Lands, Mining and Housing executive Mwandawiro Mghanga warned residents not to succumb to land cartels who lure them to offer money for land. “Those claiming to register people should keep off this exercise. This land belongs to Singila and Majengo residents and the government shall make sure that they benefit," Mwandawiro said. (Edited by V. Graham)
