Kikuyu community are the most populous in Kenya, census results have indicated. Volume IV of the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census results released on Friday noted that the community has 8.14 million people. It was followed by Luhyas at 6.82 million and Kalenjins at 6.35million. The three tribes make up almost half of the Kenyan population (44.7 per cent). The total population stands at 47.6million. Kalenjins were followed by Luos at 5 million, Kamba at 4.6million, Somalis in Kenya at 2.7 million and Kisiis at 2.7 million. Others are; Mijikenda at 2.4 million, Meru 1.9 million and Maasai at 1.1 million. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics released three special reports derived from the 2019 National Housing and Population Census on Friday. This means that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto's strongholds will make up a sizeable number that will significantly shape up the battle for numbers in 2022. Census figures will also be crucial in demarcating boundaries, another electoral consideration, and in the allocation of resources to the counties as well as national planning. The Census results show that the Jubilee political bastions of Mt Kenya, Rift Valley and Northeastern have a total of 22.4 million people. With high population numbers, the regions will also have a big share of the billions of shillings allocated to the 47 counties each year.
