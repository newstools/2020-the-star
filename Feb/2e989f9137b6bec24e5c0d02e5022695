Kenyatta University Pirates and the University of Nairobi Terrorists seek to prove a point in the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) league following their promotion to the top tier in December. Terrorists and Pirates gained automatic promotion to the top tier after finishing first and second in Division 1. Pirates last played in the KBF league in 2017 while Terrorists have been in the cold for the last five years. Pirates’ shooting guard Suleiman Gakure said they have grand plans for this year’s Premier League. “Our main goal is to reach the playoffs but first, we must work on our style of play because the top tier is a different ball game. We plan to revolutionise the league and raise the standards because the opinion out there is that Kenyan basketball players are not good enough,” he said. Pirates have been busy in the pre-season and have featured in two tournaments, where they placed second on both occasions. UoN Terrorists’ point guard Dius Gioche on his part said they are mentally ready for the top tier. “We are working on our mental strength since we know Premier League is on another level and we will need to be physical,” he said. With both teams participating in the Kenya University Sports Association, National University Basketball League and the Premier league, the two institutions plan to deploy different players for different matches with the veterans spared for the premier league. “We intend to use those in college in NUBL and KUSA leagues even though we have players who are eligible for both Kusa and Premier League,” Gioche said.                     “Playing with older and more experienced players might be a task for the new players, but we plan to adjust in the first few games,” he said.
