Former Miss Kenya Gaudentia Aura has died. Her sister confirmed her death on her Facebook page. Her sister Celestine said Aura breathed her last onÂ  Monday night. The former model was the only African face on Unilever domestic products. She was also a model of global stature and worked for various products, including Lux beauty soap. Besides her modelling career, Aura also excelled in other spheres and made a mark in the aviation industry, where she became the first Kenyan female pilot. "It's with deep sorrow, I mean sorrow upon sorrow, that you went to be with the Lord this morning. Our hearts are hardened to this truth," Celestine wrote. "Would it be a dream? The first African pilot woman, Miss Kenya, the model princess, the Lux girl, intelligent, the queen's English material."
