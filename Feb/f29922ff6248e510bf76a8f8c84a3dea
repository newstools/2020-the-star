The disappearance of flight MH370 which departed Kuala Lumpur headed to Beijing on March 8, 2014, is still a mystery six years later. It did not reach its destination, neither was it thought to have crashed until debris was found in September 2018. Until then, families of all of the 239 occupants of the flight never had closure for losing their loved ones. What remains now are possible theories as to what may have transpired such as the possibility the pilot went amok and took a suicidal nosedive several thousand feet to the ground. If this was the case, it cements further the need to give more attention to mental health as it proves to affect more than just the actual patient. The electronic flight recorder (black box) batteries last for only 30 days, which means it drained all it's power on April 7 that yearÂ and could not send any signal since. Black boxes in planes should be made to restore power for longer. They should also be able to dispatch all the flight data including the altitude and all activity in the cockpit. This way, in case of a crash, the plane will be easier to trace together with possible reasons for the crash. Meanwhile, we wish all the relatives of victims of the crash condolences.  Mombasa
