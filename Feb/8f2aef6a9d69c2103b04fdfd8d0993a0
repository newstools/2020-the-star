Two men are nursing injuries after they were hit by police stray bullets late on Sunday in Likoni, Mombasa. Suleiman Juma, 60, and bodaboda rider Chirima Mungo, 27, suffered injuries on the right shoulders, as police officers in Likoni shot in the air to disperse a criminal gang that had attacked spectators at a football tournament within Kona Mpya area. The police denied wrongdoing. Mungo is in critical condition at Coast General Hospital. Juma was rushed to Likoni Subcounty Hospital for first aid before he was transferred to Coast General, where his shoulder was operated on to remove a bullet before he was discharged. He said the police officers used live bullets immediately the gang attempted to attack the crowd. One suspect was arrested and detained at Inuka police station. Juma appealed to the government to take action against the police officers who committed the offence. "I was released from the hospital at 9am on Monday and up to now I have not taken any drug nor do I have money to buy prescribed medication," he said. Likoni subcounty police commander Jane Munywoki dismissed the allegation saying investigations will confirm what transpired. "I don’t have information on the shootout, but I have instructed for the investigations to be carried out as soon as possible to establish the fact," she said. It is alleged that a criminal gang believed to be Wakali Kwanza, armed with machetes, attacked a crowd immediately the last whistle was blown, hence preventing Bofu MCA Hamadi Salama from speaking and awarding the winners. He sponsored the tournament.
