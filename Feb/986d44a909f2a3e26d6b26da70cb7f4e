The High Court has issued orders barring the County Assembly from vetting the Deputy Governor of Nairobi County. Justice Mumbi Ngugi on Monday issued the order after the petitioner Peter Agoro argued that nomination of Anne Mwenda amounts to a direct affront to the orders issued against Governor Mike Sonko in December last year. Anti-Corruption Court Magistrate Douglas Ogoti had barred Sonko from accessing county offices unless accompanied by an investigating officer or any other authorised person. The court, while laying out his bail terms, also barred Sonko from approaching any witnesses. This was after the county chief denied charges of money laundering and unlawful acquisition of public property at City Hall amounting to Sh357 million. Agoro said the nomination of Mwenda poses a real likelihood of interfering with prosecution witnesses as she is under the direct control of Sonko. “Sonko after being charged, was ordered not to go to office or interfere with witnesses which order was given to ensure that the integrity of the prosecution process is insulated from any interference,” said Agoro. Agoro claimed that the timing of the nomination of Mwenda for the position of the DG is an act of self-preservation by Sonko and goes against the public interest in the fight against corruption. He said this was aimed at defeating the cause of justice in the corruption case he is facing. Justice Ngugi directed the DPP and County Government to file their responses in the case. The case will be mentioned on March 10, 2020. Sonko nominated Mwenda as the deputy governor on January 6. In a letter to assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi he said the decision is in line with article 180(5) of the Constitution and the Supr​_eme Court Advisory of March 2018. The embattled governor said the move further was motivated by the complexity of the situation in Nairobi following his arraignment in court.
