Lewa Wildlife Conservancy on Thursday,  February 20, 2020 held an inaugural fundraising dinner in Nairobi to support the conservancy’s work. The funds raised will help continue the work of protecting some of Kenya’s most endangered species and promoting the improvement of livelihoods for thousands of people. The fundraiser sought to cultivate a lasting partnership with Kenyan corporate organizations and individuals and supporters who are willing to help the conservancy can build a future for people and wildlife. Despite the global condemnation of poaching and the resources that have been mobilised to safeguard endangered wildlife, well-funded and well-equipped poaching groups continue to pose a real threat to Africa’s wildlife.
