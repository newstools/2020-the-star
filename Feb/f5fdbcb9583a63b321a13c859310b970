Bursary in Trans Nzoia county will, going forward, be offered to students in technical vocational training centres, the governor has announced. This is one of the austerity measures the county government is undertaking to optimise economic development, Governor Patrick Khaemba. Money will no longer be set aside for the purchase of subsidised fertiliser, he said, adding that farmers know best what to use on their farms. Khaemba addressed the House during the opening of the 4th session of the county assembly. “Bursary will narrow down to students pursuing technical education in middle-level technical institutes.  This is our main mandate as specified in the Constitution,” the governor said. In subsequent budgets, he said, bursary allocation will be reduced  and the money redirected to infrastructure and material support for education. Khaemba has also put on hold construction of new dispensaries at ward level until the existing ones are put to optimal use. “Due to the challenge of staffing and resources, it is no longer tenable to continue constructing dispensaries at ward level. There is no need for us to spread our resources so thin with little positive impact,"  he said. “The allocation [for fertiliser] will be redirected to enhance diversification." The governor announced the termination of the services of an automated revenue collection service provider, citing inefficiencies. He said a new system–which is dynamic, efficient and effective–will be developed. Khaemba urged the assembly to back his bid to complete his flagship projects which include the county teaching and referral hospital, bus park and an ultra-modern market. Edited by R.Wamochie
