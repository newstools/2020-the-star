After making his Wazito debut last weekend against Kakamega Homeboyz, 17-year old shot stopper Bixente Otieno is looking to cement his place between the sticks. Otieno was a surprise inclusion  when coach Stewart Hall named his starting team ahead of first choice Kevin Omondi and long serving Steven Njung’e. Prior to the Sunday match, the national U-20 goalkeeper had been a reserve custodian since joining the club at the start of the season. The youngster pulled a couple of good saves especially in the first half which he credited to his teammates. “ Making my debut is something I have been looking forward to all season and when the coach informed me that I would start, I was really excited. My teammates were supportive and that made everything easier. As a keeper,  communication is key and talking to my teammates especially my defenders ensured that we played well at the back. I wasn’t fazed, ” said the rookie on the club’s official website ​Despite not keeping a clean sheet on his debut, Otieno was satisfied with his performance but he believes through hard work,  he will earn more starting berths. “It would have been nice to keep a clean sheet because as a keeper, that’s the most important thing. But I am satisfied with how I performed. However, that is not my best. I will keep improving,” he added.
