TheÂ National Environment Management Authority officials stormed into a plastic manufacturing plant at Mugutha, Juja. The raid in Kiambu was carried out following intelligence from the public. Thousands of plastic bags, rolls and machines which were used to manufacture the banned plastic bags were seized. The owner of the plant escaped the arrest and is being pursued. Last week, the officials from the authority arrested seven people in Kisumu with 589 pieces of plastics bags. The culprits were arraigned for being in possession of banned plastic bags. Kenya banned the use of single-use carrier bags in February 2017. The ban took effect on August 28 that year. The ban applied to all plastic carrier bags and flat bags used for commercial and household packaging. Several arrests have been made since the ban but the bags still finds its way into the market. The authority suspects that some of the plastics still finds its way into the country from Tanzania and Uganda.
