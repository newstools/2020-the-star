Police are pursuing suspected al Shabaab militants who destroyed construction equipment in Milihoi, Lamu. The militants attacked and burned a lorry carrying cement and destroyed an excavator on Sunday afternoon. The lorry driver narrowly escaped death as he jumped off and hid in the nearby bushes. H-Young Company is constructing the Sh10.8 billion Lamu-Garsen Road. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said, " We have found the driver safe. There are no casualties, everybody is secure." Other reports indicate KDF officers had earlier engaged the attackers, with gunfire being heard as far as Mpeketoni. In July 2018, gunmen killed a police officer and injured two others in the same area. The attack came two days after militants attacked a police camp and a dispensary using PKG machine, AK47 guns and rocket-propelled grenades at Hulugho, Garissa county, on Saturday evening. Three officers were injured as joint special forces drawn from the Critical Infrastructure Protection Unit, the Kenya Police Service, Kenya Defence Forces and police reservists fought the militants, according to a police report. Prior to the Hulugho attack, a group of about 10 militants killed an 80-year-old man in Sangole Village. Police reports say the militants were targeting the old man's son who is a police reservist. The attacks happened at the backdrop of government's spirited fight against terrorism.
