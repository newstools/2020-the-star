  Meru county qualifies to be split into two due to its expansiveness, population and the number of electoral constituencies, according to Nyambene legislators. Maoka Maore (Igembe North), John Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South) and John Mutunga (Tigania West) said the split would ensure fair and equal distribution of resources. “I support Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka that we split Meru into Nyambene and Imenti counties. It's only way resources can reach every corner fairly and equitably,” Maore told the Star. The MPs spoke on Thursday ahead of today's meeting of leaders from 11 Mt Kenya counties at Kenya Methodist University. The meeting will harmonise their memoranda for presentation in Saturday's Building Bridges Initiative forum in Meru. Imenti North MP Rahim Dawood is also on record supporting the split. He said last year that time had come to change the 20 per cent of the supreme law “considered bad”. The lawmaker said Isiolo and Lamu have two constituencies each, while Tharaka Nithi has three compared to Meru's nine constituencies. A split would translate into Meru residents getting more funds, he said. Maore told off leaders opposed to BBI forums. “Tangatanga should respect the President and stay away from the Meru BBI forum of Saturday. BBI is about peace and not commotion,” he said. Mutunga said the only way to address the miraa issue is by having two counties. Ideally, Nyambene should have five MPs and six sub-counties, he said. He commended President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga for their effort to bring the country together. “BBI is not a waste of time. There is a need for it and this is the reason we are conducting consultative meetings.” Governor Kiraitu Murungi has cautioned BBI opponents to keep away from the Meru rally. "If you think that BBI is a waste of time, please stay at home. Do not come to Kinoru stadium." The forum will be attended by leaders from Embu, Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Nyeri, Laikipia, Kirinyaga, Nyandarua, Nakuru, Nairobi, Kiambu and Murang’a. Meru's population is 1,545,714 people. Igembe Central is the most populous with 221,412 people while Meru National Park has 385. South Imenti has 206,506 people, North Imenti  177,5670, Buuri 157,360, Central Imenti 133,818 and Mt Kenya Forest 463. Imenti region has a population of 675,714.
