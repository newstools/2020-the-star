Yemi Alade has premiered her most anticipated music video for the single 'Shekere', which was shot in Kenya and features Angélique Kidjo. The music video was largely shot in Kenya at the vast and grand Maasai Mara National Reserve, with the final scene at Sand River, bordering Tanzania. The cinematic visual opens up in dramatic sequence from Maasai Mara, with its backdrop being the authentic and unapologetic beauty of the African continent, specifically Kenya, a second home to Yemi Alade. In the video, Yemi is flanked by dancers, all adorned in traditional jewellery from the Maasai community. Yemi emotively sings before progressing into a stellar duet with the iconic Angélique Kidjo, who also sings in her native Benin dialect over the groovy DJ Coublon orchestrated instrumentation.
