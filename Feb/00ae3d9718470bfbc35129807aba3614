A celebration of life for the late activist Caroline Mwatha was on Saturday held at the Dandora Community Justice Centre. At least 200 human rights defenders, community members and civil society members attended the ceremony. Family and friends eulogised the human rights defender as a fighter who was ready to push for the rights of wananchi. "She was a selfless woman whom you would always approach for advice whenever in trouble. We pray that God would protect us. She has put us together and she not only left us but she gave us a family - her immediate family; her husband and children,"Â Susan Lumumba, who worked with her, said. "As quiet as she was, you would never think she would cause a storm as she did." Rights defenders vowed to continue the fight until justice is served. "Until the truth and justice are served. If they kill us, our children will continue with the struggle. We will not rest until we get justice," Githurai Justice Centre's activist Njoki Gachanja said. A memorial tree planting and fundraising for the education of her two children aged 17 and 14 was held. A vigil will be conducted in her memory after the ceremony. Mwatha was a founding member of the Dandora Justice Centre and the Social Justice Centre's working group. She was heavily involved in the documentation of extrajudicial killings in Dandora and was committed to highlighting the ills committed by rogue officers. She went missing last year on February 6. She failed to report to work after taking her daughter to school early n the morning. Her body was later found at City Mortuary.
