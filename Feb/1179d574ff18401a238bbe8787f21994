Former champions Kariobangi Sharks will not underrate their unheralded opponents Kenpoly when he two teams meet in the last 32 round of the FKF Betway Cup this weekend. Sharks coach William Muluya has exuded confidence in his team as they prepare for Sunday's duel at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Record Cup winners Gor Mahia will be the first to take to the pitch at Kasarani when they tackle lowly Naivas. Sharks, who won the Cup competition in 2018 earning a historic berth in the CAF Confederations Cup preliminary rounds have gotten their groove back in recent weeks after a slow start to the season. Ahead of the clash against the Division Three outfit, Muluya expressed optimism in his team to deliver. “The players have sufficiently trained and I believe they are more than capable to participate in the knockout stages of the FKF Betway cup on Sunday and attain a positive result,” said Coach Muluya. Forward, Eric Kapaito, expressed his heartfelt gratitude towards leading online gaming firm, Betway, in sponsoring the cup. “I honestly feel its a great move for Betway in sponsoring the Cup as it offers a sense of motivation to the participating teams and also helps bring on board other sponsors in supporting Kenyan football,” said Kapaito. The tickets for the doubleheader at  Kasarani and the Elim vs AFC Leopards match at  Kenyatta Stadium in Kitale will be sold at a flat rate of Sh100.
