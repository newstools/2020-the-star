Two gangsters allegedly involved in shooting of two M-Pesa attendants in Mombasa last week were on Sunday shot dead during an encounter with Kisauni Police officers near Shimo LaTewa Annex Prison. The two had been trailed by the detectives from Mombasa CBD but upon reaching Shanzu, they noticed the cops and branched into a rough terrain off Mombasa-Malindi where they were gunned down, after their Turkish made pistol run out ammunition while engaging the police. Kisauni Sub County Olice Commander Josphert Kiragu said the two had been on wanted list after an Mpesa attendant and her 11-month-old baby were attacked by three gunmen in Soko Mjinga Kisauni last Sunday. The woman was shot on the stomach and the same bullet hit the child on the leg. The two survived, but lost unknown amount of cash to the robbers. "We are still tracking down accomplices who are still at large but we assure the public we will net them," Kiragu said. He said the two were in their 40's but withheld their names. While there have been several known gun attacks targeting residents Mombasa this year, this is the first police killing on alleged gun-toting criminals in the city where many lost lives and dozens left with lifelong scars in machete warfare involving youth gangs last year. On Wednesday, another woman was killed during a robbery incident near Kongowea Market. Late January, armed robbers shot dead a Kenya Ports Authority accountant and stole Sh1.5 million at the Dock Workers Union office gate at Sparki, few meters from Makupa Police Station. Samwel Kinanga was shot in the stomach and died as he was being taken to hospital. His colleague was shot on the leg.
