Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated his 1,000th professional match by scoring for a record-equalling eleventh consecutive Serie A appearance to set leaders Juventus on the way to a 2-1 win at SPAL in a top-versus-bottom match on Saturday. After being rested against Brescia last week, the 35-year-old celebrated his return by scoring from Juan Cuadrado’s cross in the 39th minute before Aaron Ramsey added a second on the hour. Andrea Petagna pulled one back from a penalty in the 69th minute amid problems with the VAR system. Neither the referee’s earpiece nor the pitchside monitor appeared to be working, forcing him to use a walkie-talkie to talk to the video officials. The win ensured that Juventus, chasing a ninth successive title, stayed top for another week as they went four points clear of Lazio who visit Genoa on Sunday. SPAL’s fifth consecutive defeat left them bottom with 15 points. Ronaldo’s goal, which took his league tally for the season to 21, meant that he joined Fabio Quagliarella and Gabriel Batistuta as the only players to have scored in 11 consecutive league appearances. Quagliarella did so for Sampdoria last season and Batistuta for Fiorentina in 94-95.
