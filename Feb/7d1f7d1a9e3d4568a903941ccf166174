Lake Turkana fishermen have received 10 boats and fishing gear worth Sh15 million from the World Food Programme. WFP also donated fishing nets, extra engines and safety jackets to the fishermen at Kalokol, Kalimapus, Nachukui, Kataboi and Todonyang beaches. The equipment will help the fishermen reach deeper water where bigger fish are found. “Together with the Turkana county government we have donated the kits to the fishing community to promote the food value chain,” WFP representative for food systems and resilient livelihoods Shaun Hughes said. Deputy Governor Peter Lotethiro said Lake Turkana can produce 8,500 metric tonnes of fish but only 2.5 metric tonnes are caught due to lack of fishing equipment. “With the boats donated by WFP, fishermen at Lake Turkana will be able to catch at least 4,000 metric tonnes,” he said. Fishermen will be able to pay school fees for their children with surplus sold to regional markets, he said. Turkana Agriculture CEC Christopher Aletia warned the fishermen from catching immature fish when they have the equipment to enhance their work. In January, Kalokol residents raised the alarm over overfishing in Lake Turkana. They demanded enforcement of a ban on catching immature fish to allow for the stocks to be replenished. Residents said some officers from the department of fisheries and Congolese fish dealers are illegally exporting immature fish.
