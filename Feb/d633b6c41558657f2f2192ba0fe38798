Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Christine Ongare has vowed to ‘keep the fire burning’ after she emerged the sole victor on Sunday for Kenya national boxing teams hopes of taking fighters to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Ongare won through unanimous decision against unheralded Burundian Ornella Havyarimana as two of her highly-rated compatriots' middleweight Rayton Okwiri and flyweight African Games silver medallist Shaffi Bakari lost on a split decision. “I am happy I am still in the race for the Tokyo ticket. Most people underestimate the boxing ability of Burundians given that they don’t have a renowned history in the sport but from what I experienced in the ring, they are quality fighters and I am glad I got through. I am looking forward to today’s fight against my Congolese opponent,” she said. Ongare conceded that she has never fought an opponent from DR Congo but said it will count for nothing when they climb up the ring. “Previously I have always been set up against Nigerians or fighters from Morocco. So to fight someone from Congo will be a new experience but I am determined to keep the fire burning,” she said. Meanwhile, Shaffi conceded he lost to a worthy opponent in Ghanaian Suleiman Tetteh. “I am happy that I came out of the fight without injury. Whatever God planned for me, I accept. I wish our remaining fighters the best and hopefully, I will get a final opportunity to vie for the ticket in Paris,” said the Mombasa-born fighter. Before last night’s bouts, four Kenyans including Shaffi, Okwiri, Beatrice Akoth and Joseph Shigali had been ousted from the African Olympic Qualifiers in Dakar, Senegal. Today will be the turn of heavyweight pugilist Elly Ajowi and captain Nick Okoth to take to the ring in the quarter-finals.
