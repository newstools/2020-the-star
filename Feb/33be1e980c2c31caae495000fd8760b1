Acey Gracey, the voice behind Pace headphones, says she was pushed into music by her friends. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Acey said music is now a big part of her life. "When I am not performing, I am dejaaying somewhere. It's not something I thought about doing but people kept on telling me I had a good voice. Before I knew it, I started getting voice-over gigs," she said. Acey has lined up a live band set with Jikoni at the ultimate DJ versus Band mashup party, 'Sunday Unplugged', set to go down at The Tunnel, Mombasa Road. "It's gonna be fire," she said. "I can't wait to unleash this set. We will mash up a band and a DJ." Acey, a singing sensation and an accomplished voice-over artiste, has performed at various high-end venues, including Westgate Mall, Two Rivers, five-star hotels like Kempinski, Intercontinental and Ted Talk Parklands. She has also curtain-raised for international stars, such as Jah Cure.
