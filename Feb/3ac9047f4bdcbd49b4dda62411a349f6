President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday made a surprise visit to inspect Mzee Daniel Moi's funeral preparations at Nyayo Stadium. Uhuru drove himself to Nyayo Stadium in the GWagon ahead of memorial service on Tuesday. The President ordered that flags be flown at half-mast as an expression of public sorrow. However, before the burial, the body would lie in state at a public place for wananchi to view it. The elaborate burial ceremonies that will be rolled out in Moi's honour will mirror that of first president Jomo Kenyatta in 1978. Kenya has only accorded four individuals state burials since it's Independence in 1963.
