 The body of a three-year-old girl, who had been missing for three days, was found in a septic tank on Saturday. Aziza Mohamed, from Riyadha area of Lamu Island, had been missing since February 19. Her body was found afloat in the septic tank of a home neighbouring that of a relative she, her mother and other kin were visiting. Relatives and neighbours filed a missing person’s report at Lamu Police Station after unsuccessfully searching for her. Aziza was in kindergarten at Husna Muslim School. Residents suspected foul play and appealed for investigations to establish what happened. They also called on the county government to seal or fence off all open septic tanks, pit latrines and wells especially in Kashmir, Kandahar, Bombay, Gadeni and Langoni to forestall accidents. “There are many open wells, septic tanks and pit latrines which pose a danger to both children and adults. We urge the county to either seal them or fence them off,” Shukri Abdalla said. Lamu county police commander Moses Murithi said the child's body had started decomposing by the time it was found at 10am. He said investigations would establish if the child wandered off and accidentally fell into the tank or if she was pushed to her death. “The girl was reported missing days ago and efforts to find her had been unsuccessful. We later received information that the body had been found in a septic tank in a neighbouring compound from where they had gone visiting." The police retrieved the body and took it to King Fahad Hospital,” Murithi said. Aziza was buried on Saturday. There was speculation that the child was abducted and killed elsewhere and the body dumped in the neighbour's compound. “Normally, the body of a drowned person swells, but the child’s body was normal.  We want thorough investigations because we think someone killed this child and dumped her here,” elder Omar Mohamed said.
