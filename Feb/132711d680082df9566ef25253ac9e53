Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua has questioned the government's haste in trying to convince Kenyans to accept the Building Bridges Initiative. She has further raised concern why Kenyans are yet to receive copies of the documented report despite its release in November last year. "We need to see more openness and tolerance of divergent opinions," she said. The former lawmaker was responding to twitter threads by Statehouse Spokesperson Kanze Dena on Tuesday who said BBI was all about fixing Kenyan challenges. "BBI is about crafting a cohesive and progressive country by fixing some of the challenges facing the nation especially those brought about by the divisive nature of Kenya's electoral politics," Kanze said. This was part of what she had to say during an interview with a  local radio station. "Then why is it being rushed without giving citizens copies as promised during the Bomas launch?" Karua posed. The BBI secretariat has been urged to print out the 156-page report so Kenyans can read it. A number of politicians including Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino have accused politicians of trying to persuade Kenyans to support the report yet they don't know what it contains. Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu last month said the copies could not be printed as the day the document was being launched at Bomas coincided with the expiry of the taskforce's time. Deputy President William Ruto during a recent meeting in Vihiga criticised those behind the BBI forums across the country, saying it was a waste of taxpayers’ money. He has accused politicians of using the BBI to campaign for 2022.
