Kenya Breweries Limited, through its flagship brand Tusker, hosted its first edition of the Grill Master last weekend at K1 Club House. Consumers got a chance to interact with popular Radio Jambo presenters Mbusi and Lion, who kept the revellers up on their feet, dancing to popular reggae hits. The duo have a radio campaign title, "Tusker na Marafiki". The event rallied listeners to call in or share relatable Tusker na Nyama experiences on their digital pages for a chance to hang out with the two presenters during a Tusker activation. There were also performances by artistes Naiboi and Kagwe Mungai. Veteran DJ Nijo also kept the revellers on their feet all night long.
