We are treating Kenyans in Wuhan in a more delicate and sensitive way than China flights arriving in Kenya. These were the words of Foreign affairs CS Rachel Omamo who defended the arrival of China flights to Kenya. "Our focus are on the students locked down there...we have to deal with them in a more delicate and sensitive way given that they are in the epicentre. We have to give them special attention, monitor their well being constantly," she said. Speaking when she appeared in Parliament on Thursday, Omamo said the China Southern Airlines that arrived with the 239 passengers was dealt with according to WHO guidelines. The CS added the decision to allow 239 passengers from China on Wednesday was made in the best interest of the country. This comes after the step taken by the government to allow China Southern flights to land at the JKIA caused an uproar among Kenyans. The China Southern Airlines Flight touched down on Wednesday with 239 passengers on board. According to the Chinese Embassy to Kenya, all the passengers were screened and cleared before travelling. So far, 17 suspect cases have been recorded in the country and all have tested negative. As a Kenyan who has not travelled to China, your risk of contracting the novel coronavirus is extremely low. However, Kenya is among seven African countries seen as most vulnerable should the virus spread there.  The others are Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.
