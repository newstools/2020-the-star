The Police side edged Kenya Defence Forces (A) 3-0 (25-22, 25-23, 25-22) in the final as Prisons emerged top of a four-team round-robin competition in the women's categories.

Meanwhile, Kenya Volleyball Federation sports organising secretary Ismail Chege has registered his disappointment following the low turnout experienced during the Nyeri opening leg. “We had several teams turning up to honour their fixtures but we also had an equal number of clubs who did not show up and this affected most of the fixtures,” said Chege. Only three men’s league matches were played. Administration Police of Kenya overcame league debutants Prisons Rift Valley 26-24, 25-18, 25-21. Prisons Kenya were on a roll registering two wins, beating both Equity Bank and Forest Rangers in identical sets of 3-1. The bankers failed to cash in on the warders to go down 26-24, 25-17, 22-25 and 25-23. In their second tie, Prisons Kenya toiled to contain the thunderous spikes from the Rangers to garner maximum points in a 25-23, 25-27, 25-15, 25-23 match victory. Two ties were staged in the women’s league with Directorate of Criminal Investigation posting mixed results.

In their second, the Police side was dimmed by defending champions Kenya Prisons in 3-1 (25-12, 25-14, 20-25, 25-18) demolition. Holders General Service Unit, runners up Kenya Ports Authority and Nyeri-based KDF (men) and Kenya Pipeline women’s side showed up for the league but their opponents were a no-show.
