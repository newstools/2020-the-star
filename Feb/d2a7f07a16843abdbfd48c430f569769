The Jubilee meeting scheduled for Friday has been postponed, secretary general Raphael Tuju has announced. "Under the prevailing circumstances, may I notify Jubilee members that the consultative meeting scheduled for Friday has been postponed to a later date to be announced," Tuju said. "As the nation continues to prepare to bid farewell to the departed 2nd president of the Republic of Kenya, the late H.E Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, our party also joins Kenyans in solidarity to pay our respects." President Uhuru Kenyatta has moved to end factional fighting in his Jubilee party by ordering top officials to convene a meeting of MPs and senators on Friday this week. Sources told the Star that Uhuru directed Deputy President William Ruto, who is deputy party leader, and secretary-general Raphael Tuju to use the occasion to end the factional wars. Speaking on Sunday at ACK St Thomas Church in Kerugoya, Kirinyaga county, Ruto kept off the subject but asked leaders to rally behind Uhuru. “We must continue to support the President as he works on the transformation of the country and the unity of the nation,” Ruto said. The DP was accompanied by MPs Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu), Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Faith Gitau (Nyandarua County) and Wangui Ngirichi (Kirinyaga). Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu told the Star that the success of Friday’s meeting would depend on what happens between now and then.
