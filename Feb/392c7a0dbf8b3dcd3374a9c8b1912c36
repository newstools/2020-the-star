The FKF National Elections will be held on March 27, according to a timetable released by the national body's Electoral Board. The national polls that will see delegates vote for the president and his deputy as well as the NEC Members, will be preceded by the county polls on March 13. The board,  chaired by Kentice Tikolo, made public the elections calendar which will serve to guide on the timelines within which the electoral process will be conducted. Further, the board has published the preliminary list of clubs to vote, regulations to guide the process as well as nomination forms and checklists which aspirants are expected to download, fill and submit within the set timelines. “We have a clear road map to this electoral process, which we have to undertake within the timelines set out by Fifa,” said Tikolo. County nomination period is expected to kick off on February 13 after which the Board will verify interested candidates and publish a preliminary list. The National Executive Committee (NEC) and the presidential nomination process will then follow on February 22. An appeals window will be opened for aspirants who express dissatisfaction with the board’s decisions after which a final list of candidates will be published as per the calendar.
