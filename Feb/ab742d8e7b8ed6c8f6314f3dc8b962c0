Motorists will pay more for fuel from midnight after the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority reviewed prices. Super petrol and diesel prices have edged up by Sh2.67 per litre and Sh2.13 per litre respectively while that of kerosene dropped by Sh1.26 per litre. Motorists in Nairobi will buy a litre of petrol at Sh112.87, diesel at 104.45 while a litre of kerosene will retail at Sh102.69 for the next month. Prices at the Coast are the lowest, with a litre of petrol, diesel and kerosene going for Sh110.40, Sh101.40 and Sh100.21 respectively. In Kisumu, a litre of super petrol will go for Sh113.58 from midnight, while that of diesel will retail at Sh103.37 and kerosene Sh103.61. According to EPRA, the changes are a consequence of the increase in the average landed cost of imported super petrol, diesel and kerosene. The average landed cost of super petrol increased by 3.91 per cent from $471.01 in December to $489.44 per cubic metre while that of diesel rose by 2.68 per cent to $506.92.
