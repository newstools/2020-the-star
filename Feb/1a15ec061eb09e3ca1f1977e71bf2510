Nandi county county assembly has impeached Finance CEC Alfred Lagat. Lagat on Wednesday became the fourth CEC to be shown the door since Governor Stephen Sang took over leadership from Cleophas Lagat The assembly in a popular vote supported by 25 county representatives with only one opposing the motion, warned that should the governor fail to fire Lagat, MCAs could take the “Kiambu” way to impeach  Sang. Moving the impeachment motion, Geofrey Kevolwe -Kiptuiya ward, said 31 MCAs had signed a petition to have the CEC removed for failing to address pending bills and falling county revenues. He was also accused of snubbing assembly summons and disregarding laid down procurement procedures on various county programmes. MCAs also warned governor Sang  against protecting his senior officials. Emmanuel Mengeech (Lessos), KipkiruiChepkwony (Tinderet), Teresa Maiyo (nominated) and Osborn Komen (Terik) warned that they would impeach governor Sang if he stood in their way. “In the past we have impeached CECs, but the Executive had retained them in other capacities earning the same CEC salaries… We will have to go the Kiambu way,” Mengeech said. Amid applause from the MCAs, Komen said Nandi residents were paying heavily for the misplaced priorities from the Executive. They faulted the county's decision to procure  road building equipment which used up a large chunk of funds that had been set aside for the settlement of pending bills. Nandi county owes suppliers and contractors more than Sh1 billion. The governor said most of the bills are fake and will not be paid. Following the impeachment of the CEC, the assembly named a five-member committee to prepare a report to send Lagat home. It will be chaired by Emmanuel Mengeech, Margaret Nyauntu, Pius Murei, Fred Kipkemboi and Teresa Maiyo.
