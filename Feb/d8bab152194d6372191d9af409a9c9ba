Deputy President William Ruto has said he may have taken up his giving spirit from the late President Daniel Moi. "Moi was a very generous, giving man. Maybe some of us learnt that giving from him or he may have influenced us in some way. I remember my first interaction with Moi... a few of us students asked him to give us a piece of land in Eldoret and he actually did," he said. Ruto said he bought his first car with the proceeds from selling the land. The DP spoke during an interview with Citizen TV which aired on Thursday. When questioned about whether the land given was personal property, Ruto fumbled, but said it wasn't, but rather property that was "being given out for development". Ruto defended his being gifted a plot, insisting it was procedural. "I don't think Moi went out of his way to do something illegal." Mzee Moi passed on peacefully at Nairobi Hospital on Tuesday at 5.20am. President Uhuru Kenyatta will lead Kenyans in viewing the body of Mzee Moi at Parliament Buildings on Saturday. Members of the public will view the body on Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 8am to 5pm "The Head of State will be the first person to view the body at Parliament followed by the family members," Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said. Kinyua said the President will arrive at Parliament at 10.15 am on Saturday and requested that all State officials be seated by 9.45 am. "The cortege will leave the funeral home at 8.05 am on Saturday; and will be conveyed to Parliament Buildings with the casket being draped in the National Flag and escorted by the Family of President Moi," he said.
