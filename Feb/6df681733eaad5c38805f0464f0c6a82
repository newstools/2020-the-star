Three people have been admitted in Murang’a Level 5 Hospital after exhibiting cholera symptoms. Health CEC Joseph Mbai yesterday said the three include two adult men and a 10-year-old girl. Mbai also confirmed that the three are being treated in an isolation ward as tests are conducted to establish whether they are suffering from cholera. The three have been suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, he said, noting that they are all in a stable condition. One of the victims, Mbai said, is from Mjini slum, while the others are from Kayole estate and Wangu village. Mbai added that public health officers have also been dispatched to the patients’ homes and have done fumigation. “We have also authorised the health department to close down eateries in the affected areas for the time being until we certify where they are suffering from,” he added. Mbai appealed to locals to ensure they boil their drinking water. They suspect the contamination came from Murari River, which runs across Murang’a town. The public health department has also announced that it will crackdown on food hawking and illegal eateries in Murang’a town and its suburbs, and that staff members who are on leave have been recalled. In 2017, hundreds of people were treated after suffering from the waterborne disease in Kiunyu area in Gatanga subcounty. The patients contracted the disease from Gathwariga River from which locals get their water for domestic use. In 2015, two people died and scores hospitalised after suffering from the same disease at Kabati in Kandara subcounty. The county government then distributed free chlorine to shield locals from contamination by helping them to treat water.
