Three people have been killed after suspected al Shabaab attacked a Nairobi bound bus on Wednesday afternoon. The militants attacked the bus near Quba area in Mandera county. Northeastern regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana said the militants  waylaid the bus belonging to Moyale Raha in corner before ordering the driver to stop. "When the driver refused to stop, they followed it using three motorbikes as they spayed it with bullets indiscriminately," Ndalana said. Ndalana noted that the militants proceeded to deflect the tires before ordering all passengers to alight. “It is at this point that they shot dead two non locals . The third passenger, a local died from excessive bleeding following injuries he had sustained ,”Ndalana said. “As we speak our officers drawn from the military and the other officers are already at the area of scene. They are combing thickets where the militants are believed to be hiding. We have closed all their escape routes as we enhance our search for them." Last year, eight non locals were killed by militants between Kotulo and Wargadud, The then regional commissioner Mohamed Birik directed the Garissa, Wajir and Mandera security and intelligence committees to enforce the directive of ensuring that buses have escort. Birik said all drivers must comply to guarantee the safety of travelers on Garissa-Holugho, Garissa-Liboi and Garissa-Wajir roads, among other routes all the way to Mandera.
