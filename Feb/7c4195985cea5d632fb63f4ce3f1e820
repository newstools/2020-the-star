Vihiga Queens prolific forward Terry Engesha is banking on the team's style of play to win the top scorer award for the second consecutive season. Engesha won the inaugural Kenya Footballers Welfare Association (KEFWA) Women player of the year award with 36 goals in last year's Women Premier League. The 22-year old striker whose hunger for goals made headlines when she scored four goals against Hallbybrann on her debut for Swedish Division two side Dalhem IF in 2018. Engesha has been a constant fixture for Starlets as well though she missed the Olympic qualifiers through injury. Queens has won the title three times in a row and she has been central to the team's success. "I want to better my goal tally. Last season was good and the coming one should be better. I can't tell my exact target but I will do better," said Engesha. "I cannot say that I have a perfect partnership with certain players in the team. Ours is team effort and a style of play that suits me most since I can play in different positions and still deliver. Almost every player has had a hand in my goals. As a team, we want to pick from where we left." Meanwhile,Queens' coachÂ Alex Alumira wants his charges to start the new season on a high even though they face a tricky fixture away against Tranzoia Falcons this weekend. The defending champions won both legs last season and were the only side that beat the team in their own yard amongst the big six. "They are not a walk in the park and we have to be prepared physically and psychologically. They make life hard for teams at their backyard but we want maximum points," said Alumira.
