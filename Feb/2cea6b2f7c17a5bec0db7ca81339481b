The movers of the Building Bridges Initiative have it all wrong; they are injecting the typical politics we are used to–us versus them. There is nothing wrong with citizens and leaders holding different viewpoints. It would be foolhardy to assume we would all belong in the same box. It is healthy and democratic to be critical and in such a case, including grandstanding on ideas. When and where we differ, we ought to employ the intellect of persuasion rather than brute force. If the BBI is about peace and unity, you would expect its proponents to be diplomatic and persuasive. It is apparent this is not the direction, going by the tone of the three rallies called to drum up support for the report. Speakers have allowed themselves to be carried away by public euphoria, as they focus on winning approval by presenting ‘their new political invention’ which to be honest, is not new to us–it was just shelved after its 15 minutes of fame probably hoping Kenyans would forget. Characterised by bashing, intolerance, bravado and chiding opponents, a typical ugly political hallmark of the old is deeply embedded in the drivers of BBI, making it lose its nobility. One would aptly assume the BBI is just a camouflaged vehicle to push for a political agenda of some actors. It has been hijacked by the political honchos with selfish interest as the committee of experts expected to be the main drivers are relegated to spectators. Peace still resides amongst us, for diversity doesn’t necessary profess instability. We are unique, different and cannot all be thinking the same way concerning the BBI but we are all Kenyans, peace-loving and industrious. Those holding contrary opinions are not enemies of peace or of the President.  Wasio, Migori
