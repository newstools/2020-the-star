Some Kenyans could not hold back tears and were overcome by grief and shock after viewing the body of former President Daniel Moi outside Parliament Buildings on the third day he lay in state. Some wailed uncontrollably while others fainted after queuing to view Mzee Moi's body on the last day of public viewing. It took the intervention of officials from St John Ambulance to help those who were engulfed in shock. Moi's son Baringo Senator Gideon Moi was seen later thanking those who were in the long queue as he made his way to his car outside Parliament Buildings. Leaders who have already viewed the body include President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto, retired President Mwai Kibaki members of the diplomatic corps, legislators, governors and religious personalities. On Monday, Chief Justice David Maraga and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka viewed the former President's body and paid their last respects. The Former Head of State is being accorded full military ceremonial honours, which include, conveyance of the body under escort in a gun carriage, accompanied by military musical honours and a 19 gun-salute. On Tuesday, an interdenominational service will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi. The day has been gazetted as a public holiday forÂ Kenyans to participate in the State ceremonies and also take time to honour Moi by reflecting on ways to foster the wellness of the nation. Moi will be interred on Wednesday at his home in Kabarak.
