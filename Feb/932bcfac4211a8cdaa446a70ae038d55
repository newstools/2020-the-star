Nyeri county has translated excerpts of the BBI report into Kiswahili so residents can understand what politicians are shouting about. And they can make up their own minds and forget the political noise. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said they got brief highlights from the Building Bridges Secretariate and translated them into Kiswahili. “We are currently looking for a printer to handle more than  10,000 copies for the people of Nyeri both in English and Kiswahili,” Kahiga said. The governor said on Saturday that they will use schools, churches and other government systems to ensure the copies reach as many residents as possible. The translated copies will start being distributed in the next week. He praised the Building Bridges Initiative report, saying it proposes an increase in revenue to counties which governors have been lobbying for. “I remember we had the Ugatuzi Initiative whose key was to increase revenue to the counties and we really appreciated that,” he said. The BBI recommends that counties get 45 per cent of the total national budget. It is also meant to bring equality and will address the struggle for power by different communities. The governor called on residents to read and understand the report to be in a position to present their views to the BBI rally in Nyeri. “We will announce the day, it might be on February 29, on February 28, we will meet about 3,000 delegates drawn from every field," Kahiga said.
