LONG serving Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) secretary general, Vitalis Gode, will not seek re-election when the polls are called on April 25. Gode yesterday said he has informed the executive of his intention to retire during a meeting held over the weekend. “My tenure is coming to an end and I will not be seeking re-election during the April polls. I have made it clear that I will be engaged elsewhere during the exercise,” Gode said. He said it was time to do other things after being in administration for over 30 years— 16 of which he served in the demanding position of KBF secretary general. “Those are many years I have given my dedicated services to this sport—both locally and regionally—and I feel it is time to serve in other areas,” he added.  Gode first tenure as the secretary general started in 2004 and was re elected in subsequent polls in 2008, 2012 and 2016. Besides serving in the national office, his first role as an elected official was in 1990 when he was voted as the secretary general of KBF Central Province. He said he will still retain his FIBA Africa Zone 5 secretary general post, where he was elected in 2006 until the elections are held later. The much travelled Gode has been to over 40 cities in the world both as an international referee and instructor. Gode officiated at the 2012 London Olympics, World Championships in Brazil in 2006 and  Turkey in 2010.  He also did duty in U19 World Championships in Serbia, New Zealand, Italy, Spain and Greece.
