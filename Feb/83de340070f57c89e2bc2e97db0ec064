New Bandari coach Ken Odhiambo will have to wait longer to make his first appearance on the touchline. This is after the coast-based club confirmed that their former tactician Bernard Mwalala had a running contract despite being suspended. Odhiambo returned to the club on Tuesday barely two years after exiting to pursue Sports Administration training  in Sudan but he is yet to be unveiled Mwalala was asked to step aside last month following a series of unwanted results and was replaced by the club’s technical director Twahir Muhiddin albeit on an interim basis. The dockers had not terminated Mwalala’s contract and unveiling Odhiambo would amount to a breach of the same hence attracting litigation. The genesis of the standoff is believed to be the club’s reluctance in buying out Mwalala’s contract Meanwhile, Mwalala who returned home in Kitale has lamented over  Bandari’s delay in deciding on his future. The former Nzoia Sugar tactician noted that the delay had blocked other clubs from sourcing his services. He also revealed that he had not received his salary in the last three months contrary to the provisions of the suspension letter which he said requires the club to pay him even when he is away. “I still have a contract with Bandari which locks me from signing another deal. They are yet to pay me for the last three months which makes it even tougher for me. From the letter they gave me the day they elected to suspend me, it was clear that the club should continue paying me until they axe me. In the meantime, I am enjoying life back at home and hope  that the dust will settle soon,” he said
