West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo on Thursday led the disbursement of Sh400 million worth of bursary cheques at Ortum Boys High School set to benefit students in the county. The money will help both secondary school students from form two to four and college students. He said, the Ministry of Education will release an additional Sh150 million to fund form one students in June. Ortum Boys High School, which has the highest number of students in the county, was handed a Sh14 million bursary fund. The school also received Sh2 million from the county government to fund the construction of a multipurpose hall. Lonyangapuo on Thursday said the hall will be the largest in the county and will serve the community well. The charismatic governor also requested for more teachers to be deployed in the county. "Tunataka kuomba TSC na ministry of Education, Kuna counties ambazo ziko na walimu mpaka spare. Na hawana njaa na tamaa ya elimu kama sisi, mtusaidie," he said. (I want to request TSC and the Ministry of Health to focus on us as there are counties with excess teachers but lack the desire for education that we have.) Lonyangapuo said part of the money released will be used to pay teachers employed by Board of Governors. He said West Pokot has witnessed 100 transition from primary to secondary school. Lonyangapuo said the county will deal with corruption in education facilities thoroughly.
