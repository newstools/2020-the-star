A postmortem on the boda boda rider who was shot by a police officer at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital will be conducted today, Tuesday. The autopsy is expected to establish how Daniel Mburu was shot and the cause of his death. DCI detectives on Thursday asked the court for more time to detain constable Zadock  Oyieko, attached to the Administration Police. The officers said they needed the time to record statements from witnesses and get the postmortem report. The suspect was arraigned in Makadara law courts on Thursday and will remain in custody until February 28. On Monday, the officers reviewed the CCTV footage at the scene of the crime and are expected to table the evidence in court once the investigations are over. A case filed at Independent Medico-Legal Unit shows Mburu’s brother was also shot by police in 2009 under unclear circumstances. Mburu was killed at the hospital’s security sentry on Tuesday last week after a quarrel with security officers. He has had ferried a woman and her son who had been rescued from drowning in a river in Korogocho where he lived. Witnesses said there was a brief altercation at the hospital gate where Mburu had packed his motorcycle and the officer slapped the deceased before taking him into a sentry. Minutes later, the witnesses heard a gunshot.  When they rushed to the sentry, they found Mburu being dragged by security officers with blood coming from his chest. The incident prompted residents, who included boda boda operators, to stage demonstrations in front of the facility for close to four hours until the body was moved to City Mortuary. Ochuka was immediately disarmed by colleagues and taken to Kayole police station where he recorded a statement before he was released. He was later rearrested after a preliminary ballistic report showed the killer bullet was from his firearm. This was easily established because there were two officers on duty on Tuesday evening when the incident occurred.
