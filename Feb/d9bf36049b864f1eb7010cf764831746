The Mombasa Labour and Social Welfare Committee has two weeks to present a report on the exploitation of Kenyan workers in the Middle East. Speaker Ebrahim Aharub gave the timeline following public and county assembly members' complaints that Kenyan workers were treated like slaves in the Middle East countries. There have been several cases of private labour recruitment agencies trafficking Kenyans to foreign countries. They promise good jobs but the applicants end up being slaves in those countries. "Our people are being manipulated by foreign employers. I want the chairperson of the committee Renson Thoya to tell me if his office is aware of what our people are going through in the hands of foreigners," nominated MCA Amriya Boy Juma said in a motion before the house. Nominated MCA Mary Naliaka, who is a member of the welfare committee, said: "This is a crucial matter. I need time to talk to my chairperson (who was not present). We need to come up with a consultative report. Give us two weeks." Mkomani MCA Kizito Opeya, who is also a member of the committee, said they should be given two weeks to come up with a consultative report. They need to identify the labour agencies and look for victims to provide detailed information. However, Juma said two weeks is too long a time in a matter of public interest.Â  He called on his colleagues to be attending all house sittings to give weight to matters of public interest and provide answers as demanded.
