Jamaican reggae-dancehall sensation and legend Buju Banton performed at the KICC Grounds last weekend to thousands of reggae fans. The 'Destiny' singer, who performed in Kenya for the first time, thrilled his fans with hit after hit, both from his latest and old albums, leaving the world asking for more. The concert was unique since Kenya was the first country in Africa he visited since he left prison a year ago after serving seven years of a 10-year jail sentence in the US. He is popularly known for his chart-topping hits, such as 'Walk like a Champion', 'Destiny', 'Murderer', 'Hills' and 'Valleys'. There was a surprise appearance by Ugandan politician and artiste Bobi Wine.
