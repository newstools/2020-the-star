Politicians, leaders and Mt Kenya residents on Saturday graced the BBI rally in Meru county. There was pomp and color as leaders walked in style to the podium with thousands of residents seated. Even as the leaders made remarks at the podium, residents were seen laughing and making dialogues in different areas. Last week on Thursday, MPs from Mt Kenya warned that unless the BBI proposals appreciate the principle of one-man-one-vote, they will reject it. The lawmakers said a parliamentary system would 'further disadvantage' the region. Ealier, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and Elgeyo Marakwet Kipchumba Murkomen stormed out of the BBI rally in Meru. The leaders, who were accompanied by Chuka-Igambang'ombe MP Patrick Munene, left when EALA MP Mpuru Aburi was speaking.
