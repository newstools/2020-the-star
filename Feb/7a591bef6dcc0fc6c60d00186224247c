This week the National Youth Service will start collecting the garbage for Nairobi county (see P23). The one-year renewable contract will start in five zones — Roysambu, Kamkunji, Makadara, Embakasi East and Ruaraka — but private refuse collectors may still be hired for areas where garbage has piled up. Garbage collection is potentially very profitable. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is in court charged with colluding in a fraudulent contract where the county paid a garbage company Sh357 million over five months. Refuse is still piling up in Nairobi but Sonko claims the situation has deteriorated in the two months he has been out of office. The refuse collection system in Nairobi is clearly broken and needs to be fixed. The NYS contract will buy time for the county and national governments to decide on the way forward. The NYS trainees have done a good job providing security at JKIA, KICC and elsewhere. They are taking on some roadbuilding. What is wrong with garbage collection as work experience? It is a job that needs to be done and it will teach them team spirit and to respect all walks of life.
