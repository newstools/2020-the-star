Former long-serving Cabinet Minister  Henry Kosgey has said he learnt to be generous when he worked under retired President Daniel Arap Moi. Moi, who died yesterday aged 95, appointed Kosgey to the Cabinet at 32 after winning the Tinderet parliamentary seat in 1979. Kosgey described Mzee Moi as his mentor who taught him to always be generous and to focus on education and supporting the less fortunate people in society. In his condolence message to the Moi family, Kosgey said it was through Mzee Moi's advice that he supported the poor and paid fees for their children. “It was through his spirit and advise that I ensured I improved infrastructures in many schools in Nandi and more so try and secure employment opportunities for the young people,” Kosgey said. He said his frequent wise counsel enabled him to withstand several political and social challenges. “Moi initiated several landmark development programmes for our country and we will forever remember him for them among them universities, middle-level colleges and hospitals among others,” Kosgey said. The ex-president initiated Moi and Maseno universities and upgraded Egerton College, Kenyatta, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology among many others. He is also behind the establishment of the Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology in Nakuru, Nyayo ward hospital in Elburgon town, Nakuru, and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret.
