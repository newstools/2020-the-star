A video of a Ugandan MP carrying a bottle full of desert locusts in parliament has been shared online. David Obala, who represents Ngora county in eastern Uganda, had brought the locusts to parliament on Tuesday to protest against the government's alleged slow intervention to curb the locust outbreak that has devastated crops across the region, raising fears of food shortages. After another MP protested, Mr Obala was forced to give the bottle to the sergeant-at-arms, who helps maintain order in parliament. The speaker asked for a weekly briefings from the ministry on spraying efforts. Uganda's Daily Monitor newspaper tweeted a video of Mr Obala with the locusts.
