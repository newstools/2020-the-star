ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has defended retired President Daniel Moi against accusations of dictatorship during his 24-year rule. “Moi was not a dictator. He was a firm leader who had the interests of Kenyans at heart. He was determined to protect what belongs to Kenyans,” Mudavadi said. Mudavadi said Moi, who died on Tuesday aged 95, was misunderstood by many Kenyans. He said that Moi was a good leader who welcomed people’s divergent ideas to build the nation. “A number of us who worked with him disagreed on a number of occasions at work. But he would examine our proposals and later agree to them if they were viable,” Mudavadi said yesterday. Moi's last deputy spoke to the Voice Of America Television on his experience working under the Moi. He was appointed by Moi as a Finance Minister in 1992 at 33 years old and tasked to reform the economy. The ANC leader was later appointed the vice president by Moi in 2002. He served for three months to 2002 elections, which Kanu lost. “Moi appointed me at 33 to address inflation and put the economy back on track. We were many in the government and we worked under him as a team," Musalia said. Mudavadi described Moi as a firm leader who protected the country’s resources. "He supported us with ideas, experience and ensured we delivered," he said. The former deputy prime minister said that Moi’s rule did not discourage his ambitions to become the country’s president. Mudavadi said that he has learned lessons from the ex-president that will help him in his political journey ahead of the 2022 elections. He added that President Uhuru Kenyatta is not ready to manipulate the Constitution so that he overstays in power. “It's pure propaganda and I believe he can’t do that. He will serve his time and go home,” he said.
