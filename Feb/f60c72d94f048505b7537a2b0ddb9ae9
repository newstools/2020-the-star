President Uhuru Kenyatta has eulogised former president Daniel Moi describing him as a calm and a steady leader. "It is with a heavy heart that the sun has set on a thoughtful leader...one who served the nation with dignity and honor..one whose wisdom kept Kenya relevant and neutral," Uhuru said. Addressing the nation on Saturday, Uhuru said Moi was a tactful leader and chose what was best for our country. "He was a visionary leader. When his party lost in 2002 election, he left office with a gracious last word of advice to those who took the heavy responsibility," he said. "We celebrate the life of a patriot who found himself raising the hopes of everyone. No part of Kenya was strange to him. Deep in his DNA he has understood our culture and our national character." Uhuru said Moi remained faithful to defend his people until his last day in office. "A passing cloud that served Kenya for 24 years..a decisive and courageous commander in chief who always put his country first," he said. "May we prove ourselves worthy of his bequest. We commit his soul to God and thanking God for sending us his servant," he said. Uhuru said Moi was a balanced leader who during the clamour for multipartism on listening to both sides chose well, setting the stage for a national rebirth. The president spoke after he arrived from the US on Friday night. He is expected to lead Kenyans in viewing Moi's body at Parliament buildings. The public will be able to view the former President's body until Sunday. Moi will be buried on Wednesday at his home in Kabarak.
