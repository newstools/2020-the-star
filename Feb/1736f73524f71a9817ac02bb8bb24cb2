The Taita Taveta County government wants to promote Voi's Standard Gauge Railway station as a centre of tourism, business and transport in collaboration with the Kenya Railways Corporation. Trade, Tourism, Gender Culture and Cooperatives executive Milkah Righa says the partnership will open a chance for locals to showcase the county's culture through dances, curios and other artefacts. This will create jobs to hundreds of youths in the fast-growing town. "We have an opportunity of growing the tourism sector once we partner with the Kenya Railway Corporation. We can have a tourism information centre at the SGR station to market our tourism destinations," Righa said. The department wants to occupy stalls where selected groups can run a cafeteria and sell curios. There will also be a county tourism information desk. "We want to engage KR on the possibility of opening up businesses in the available spaces set aside by the management," she said in Voi on Sunday after a meeting with KR officials. The expansive Tsavo National Park, as well as wildlife sanctuaries, lodges and Vuria Hills, are in the county. Other tourist attractions are Lake Chala, Lake Jipe, Mzima Springs, Lugard Falls and historical Taveta town. Voi is the third busiest station after Nairobi and Mombasa. It has two passenger stations.
