Zen Members from the Dojo Wellness Club in Karen were recently treated to an exclusive wine-tasting event. Charles Perrin of Famille Perrin, one of the most prestigious winemaking families in the world, personally guided the guests through a selection from his wines of Perrin Wineries, Château de Beaucastel, Château de Miraval (owned by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt) and La Vieille Ferme. Guests were delighted to experience the holistic lifestyle approach that Dojo encourages by combining wellness, healthy living and bringing people together.
