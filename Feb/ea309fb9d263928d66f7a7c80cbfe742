Cold-blooded killers should be killed and the law should be amended to allow that. This proposal was made by Vihiga Senator George Khaniri on Saturday in Ingidi village in reaction to the murder of Vihiga businessman, his wife and child last Friday. Another child suffered injuries. Khaniri visited the bereaved. Agrovet owner Kennedy Ambani, 40, of Magada trading centre, Elizabeth Achieng’ and Ann and Gifton suffered several panga cuts. The attack followed a spate of other killings in the county in recent months. Khaniri said there is no need to tolerate people who have no respect for humanity. He cautioned against allowing criminals to mingle with law-abiding citizens. He called for thorough investigations to ensure perpetrators are punished. "As a normal human being, how do you just start cutting your fellow man with a panga to death?" Khaniri  asked. "There must be something wrong with them and such people should not be allowed to mix with us." He appealed to security officers to intensify night patrols to reduce attacks and keep residents safe. The assailants did not steal anything from the family. The community has left residents in fear. MCA Victor Ijaika, who accompanied the senator, called for the establishment of another police station, saying the only police post in the area cannot serve residents adequately. Khaniri told the police to "stop these shenanigans of rotating up and down in this county collecting bribes in chang'aa dens and subjecting our people to danger". "Our security teams in the country are well equipped and well facilitated too. However, they are using equipment improperly for their own gain and subjecting the public to insecurity," he said. "Kilingili killers are still walking freely after the massacre of the five nightguards. The Chavakali killers are still walking free after killing two nightguards. Itenji killers are still walking free after killing a man and his wife. Will these Ingidi killers also walk freely?"
