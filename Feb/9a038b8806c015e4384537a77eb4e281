The Building Bridges Initiative has the solution to the huge pending bills problem that has bedevilled the counties, ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has said. Osotsi said increased allocation to the counties will ensure they have money to meet most of their development projects. He regretted that most devolved units have been struggling to clear their pending bills, hence using some of the money meant for development projects. “Counties like Vihiga will not register any development with pending bills of Sh1.8 billion to pay,” Osotsi said. “Therefore, we need to increase revenue allocation to counties from the current 15 per cent to between 35 and 45 per cent.” Osotsi spoke on Sunday at Mudzu Salvation in Central Maragoli, Vihiga.  He said residents’ views will be added to those collected from other parts of the country to help in generating the question to be subjected to a referendum. The lawmaker said they have developed a budget policy that will take care of the referendum. Osotsi condemned the rise in crimes in the county, citing several killings blamed on a gang. Last Friday, a Vihiga trader, his wife and two children were murdered by a gang of seven youths at their Busamu home. Agrovet owner Kennedy Ambani of Magada trading centre, Elizabeth Achieng’ and their children Ann and Gifton suffered several panga cuts. Osotsi promised to raise the matter with the authorities. “I’ll compel the Cabinet Secretary for Internal Security to explain why these killings are skyrocketing.” On the census, he called for a thorough audit of the figures. “We know the government distributes resources to counties depending on numbers.” The legislator criticised the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics for releasing ethnic population data. He said resources should be equated to people within specific boundaries such as the counties and not using ethnic numbers. He said ethnic figures make room for the marginalisation of the minorities.
