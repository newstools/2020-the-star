Wolverines have been advised to be ruthless in front of goal this season if they hope to survive in the KHU  Premier League. The newbies will play in the top tier for the first time since their inception in 2018 and despite their new-found status, coach Gordon Oduor wants the players to add a clinical edge to their game. The team is having a good training regime and trying to improve on their last "We have to approach the Premier League pragmatically. In the Super League, we had different approaches for each team. We have to be sharper," he said. Oduor said despite winning last year, their margin was not convincing. "The team will have to convert the half-chances because if they don't they can be punished," said Oduor who doubles up as a player at Parkroad. Oduor is also banking on the experience of their playing unit to have a fruitful season. "Almost half of my team have played in the top tier in 2017 though not for Wolverines. We are going to put our best foot forward for a better season. Right now,  I cannot tell how far the team will go because we need to gel a little bit." Wolverines have bolstered their squad with the acquisitions of midfielders  Jackline Gakuya and Mary Kiani. The duo were signed from Kenyatta and Multimedia universities respectively. Former Sliders defender Lucy Kariuki has also been brought on board. Pauline Ochieng, who was named the Most Valuable Player in the Kenya Hockey Union league and who also doubles up as HockeyKe women's Super League player of the year, will provide the killer instinct up front.
