The High Court has dismissed a second appeal by a Kitui man convicted of defilement and sentenced to a 20-year jail term. Titus Musyoka sought a reduction of his sentence. He defiled a 13-year-old in Kitui on January 15, 2022, at Makaani River after brandishing a knife. Musyoka then gave the girl Sh50 with which she bought a lunch box and body cream. They were neighbours. In his appeal, Musyoka said investigations were shallow, shoddy and poorly conducted, adding that the prosecution entirely relied on hearsay. He submitted that the complainant's evidence lacked truth and the key element of the charge was not proved beyond any reasonable doubt. He, therefore, sought a fair trial. "An essential witness was not summoned to court to shed light on the matter. And the evidence of the complainant was inconsistent and contradictory,” Musyoka said. The court, however, rejected his plea. "We dismiss the appeal and uphold the appellant’s conviction and sentence as meted out by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court,” Justice Hannah Okweng’u said. Another neighbour had said that he found Musyoka in the act. He fled, leaving the girl behind. According to court documents, the girl went home but did not inform her mother that Musyoka had defiled her, as he had threatened to kill her if she told anyone. The mother told court that her daughter had gone to church and returned home at about 1pm with a food box and body cream. Upon inquiry, the girl said Musyoka had given her the money to buy the two items after sleeping with her. The trial court concluded that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence, Justice Okweng’u confirmed that a 20-year jail term imposed by the trial court was lawful. She said Musyoka took advantage of the mentally challenged girl.
