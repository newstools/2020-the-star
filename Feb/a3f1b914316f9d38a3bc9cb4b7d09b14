Politician Stanley Livondo has moved to court seeking interpretation of deputy governors running for governor in the next election. Livondo says some of the current governors and deputy governors are serving their second term. He adds that various governors of the 47 counties still intend to vie for elective posts of Executive nature. “Unless the Constitution is interpreted the governors and deputy governors have a high likelihood of vying for either the deputy governor’s seat or the governor's seat respectively”, Livondo says in court documents. He alleges that he is aware some of the current deputy governors have already intimated that they intend vie for the governor in the next general election in 2022. Livondo claims that the deputy governors under Article 180(5) of the Constitution nominees and appointees of the governors of their counties who are qualified to vie. He says for a person to be eligible for election as a governor that person must be eligible for election as a member of county assembly as under Article 193 of the Constitution.
