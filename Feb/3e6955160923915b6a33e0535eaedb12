Works on the four pedestrian footbridges on the Thika Superhighway are on schedule, the Kenya National Highways Authority has said. Kenha director-general Peter Mundinia said Wednesday that the four projects which are aimed at enhancing pedestrian safety are at various stages of completion. "The footbridges are at Witeithie, Jomoko, Kenya School of Monetary Studies and Garden City Mall," he said. The construction of Witeithie and Jomoko footbridges commenced in March 2018 and is being undertaken by Interways Works Limited at a cost of Sh430 million. "The contractor has already erected a steel barrier at the median to prevent pedestrians from crossing the road hence risking their lives. The footbridge has been completed and has been opened for use by the public," he said. Mundinia said the contractor for the Witeithie and Jomoko footbridges is currently building additional service roads and bus bays on each side of the road. This, he said, will ensure passenger and pedestrian safety. The existing speed bumps will be removed and road service restored. "At the Jomoko footbridge the contractor has already concreted the deck awaiting the concrete to cure before opening the footbridge by the end of March," Mundinia said. At the Kenya School of Monetary Studies and Garden City Mall footbridges, the construction work is ongoing. He said the construction of the two footbridges is being undertaken by Fourways Construction Limited at a combined cost of Sh392 million. "The steel decks will be installed in April and the contractor is expected to deliver the project by end of May 2020." Kenha has instructed the contractor to fast-track the removal of the central pier holding structure to reduce traffic snarl-up along the carriageway. Mundinia said the authority has planned to implement additional footbridges along the Thika Superhighway in all sections where speed bumps exist. The authority will reveal details of some of the programme soon. (edited by O. Owino)
