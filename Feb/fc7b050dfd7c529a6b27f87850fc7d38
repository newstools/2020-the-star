Berlin-based celebrated disc jockey DJ Angelo launched Reloop DJ Brand in the Kenyan market on Thursday. The Reloop brand ambassador said during the launch, “This is my first time in Africa, and I look forward to a fruitful visit, where I will share as much as I know about the German DJ scene and also hope to learn about Kenyan and African music, culture and DJ industry.” Adding, "I hope to meet as many Kenyan DJs as possible to take notes from them and even carry Kenyan music with me when I go back home." The Reloop DJ Development Centre off Kiambu Road was also officially opened during the event, as a learning place of excellence that will offer wholesome training to DJs. During his stay, DJ Angelo will showcase his skills at different clubs and events in Nairobi. He will also hold a mentorship session for Kenyan DJs.
