Embu open-air market traders want the hard copies of the Building Bridges Initiative report, claiming they cannot afford to download it commercially. The traders from Embu, Manyatta and Runyenjes towns said they don’t know the contents of the report and sought the assistance of former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti. They told Kivuti that they were eager to read the document to know where to amend or add. They declined the former senator's offer to make the report available through  WhatsApp and email, insisting on printed copies "to read thoroughly". Kivuti, who was accompanied by MCA Morris Muchiri and former Manyatta MP Emilio Kathuri, promised to consult, on their behalf, Governor Martin Wambora who is the coordinator of the BBI initiative in the county. He visited the markets on Saturday and implored the traders to support the report as most of it is about development.
