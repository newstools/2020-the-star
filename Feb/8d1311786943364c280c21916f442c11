The High Court in Kisumu has dismissed a vandalism case against former Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga and Senator Fred Outa after the complainant failed to appear in court. The two were charged with vandalising equipment belonging to the IEBC in 2017. Diana Odhiambo, an official with the Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission, who claimed she suffered serious injuries during the alleged attack, has since 2018 failed to appear in court, despite summons. Chief magistrate Peter Gesora said the hearing could not proceed in the absence of Odhiambo because it affects the co-accused. "The alleged complainant has not appeared in court since 2018 and the court has considered everything possible, including a statement from the prosecution. I hereby order this case withdrawn and security bond and cash bail to be returned to the accused," magistrate ruled. The ruling follows an earlier postponement a week ago when Francis Odhiambo, one of the accused, failed to turn up. His lawyer said the no-show was due to a "medical emergency." Outa and Odinga were charged before chief magistrate Julius Nga'rnga'r in 2017. The were accused of attacking IEBC officials, disrupting training, damaging chairs and tents worth Sh92,500.
