 State officers attending BBI rallies are not campaigning but only following a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko has said. Tobiko on Saturday said all civil servants were behind the Building Bridges Initiative and have the right to attend the meetings. Speaking during the 5th BBI consultative forum at the Narok Stadium, Tobiko said ministers attending the rallies were not campaigning for anybody but only showing support for the unity call spearheaded by Uhuru and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. “I am speaking on behalf of all civil servants that we are not in campaign mood but supporting what was started by our general who is President Kenyatta after the handshake with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and led to peace among Kenyans,” Tobiko said. The meeting was also attended by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Amina Mohamed (Sports). Tobiko said he was happy with the restoration process of the Mau Forest that is underway. “Even the current presence of rain in most parts of these areas is a result of the restored Mau Forest and we will continue to ensure that the forest is fully recovered,” Tobiko said. The CS said the evictions of illegal settlers from the Mau Forest was not targeting any tribe but to ensure the conservation of the water tower. “Most of our rivers have Mau as their only source and it is paramount to conserve this forest by all means,” he said. He said evictions will continue for the proper conservation of Mau Forest. “Raila tried by all means in 2009 to evict illegal settlers from Mau Forest but this government has now tried to flush out these settlers to stop them from causing further destructions of this important resource,” Tobiko said.  edited by peter obuya
