The Health ministry has brushed off the possibility of a malaria outbreak noting a slight increase but within limits. General Health Services acting director Patrick Amoth on Saturday knocked back reports of the outbreak linking the increased cases to increased levels of rainfall experienced in the country in the last seven months. Amoth said the reported cases are within the expected malaria incident limits calling for no cause of alarm. The ministry further indicates that the distribution of anti-malaria drugs had been scaled up in the affected counties. In January, Elgeyo Marakwet reported three deaths linked to malaria including a two and a half-year-old female child, a Form 1 student and a 76-year-old man. The ministry says the student was from Kakamega county and "medication came a little too late". The assessment by the ministry indicates a sustained increase in malaria in Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties. "This increase is attributed to the elevated rains experienced from October to December, which led to localised flooding sustaining mosquito breeding and subsequent intense malaria transmission," the ministry's statement reads. The ministry, however, says no death has been reported in Baringo county linked to malaria. Edited by R.Wamochie
