Reigning Olympic men’s football champions Brazil qualified for this summer’s tournament in Japan with a 3-0 win over Argentina on Sunday. Brazil had to beat their arch-rivals in the Colombia qualifier in order to join them as one of South America’s two representatives at the Tokyo Games. Paulinho scored the opener after 11 minutes before Matheus Cunha added a second on the half-hour mark and a third early in the second half. Argentina had already qualified for Tokyo after winning their first two matches in the round-robin qualifying tournament. Uruguay lost out despite beating hosts Colombia 3-1 earlier on Sunday. Brazil won the gold medal at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, giving them the last major international title to have eluded them. Meanwhile, an Argentine second division match between Independiente Rivadavia and Atlanta was abandoned on Sunday after police said they were unable to guarantee safety as armed fans fought on the terraces. The referee took the players off the pitch shortly after kick-off and halted the game for 20 minutes as the fighting broke out before eventually deciding to call the match off with the score at 0-0. Television pictures showed fans armed with knives and burning flags behind one of the goals in the Mendoza stadium. Both clubs said on Twitter the game had been abandoned as police were unable to ensure safety. Argentine media group TyC Sports reported two people had been injured. The incident is the latest in a long line of violent clashes in and around Argentine football grounds with much of the violence related to the barras brava, the hooligan ‘firms’ attached to many of the clubs.
