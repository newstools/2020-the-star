Murang’a Seals coach David Mahira has defended the club fans against accusations of violent conduct following crowd trouble that marred their match against Coast Stima. The match ended in a 1-1 draw. The match played at Seal’s new home ground at St.Sebastian Park in Murang’a County saw Stima fans accosted by angry home supporters. However, Mahira said the majority of their fans were new to football and accused the visitors of provoking them. “There was a lot of uncalled for the abuse coming from a section of the Stima fans, forcing our fans to react. I am happy the situation did not spill over and the match was completed,” said Mahira. The coach asked the county government to speed up the building of roads in the area to make access to the stadium easier. “Hosting matches at St.Sebastian obviously brings a lot of business to the county as teams camp here for up to two days. So we challenge the county government to repair the roads to make travel to the stadium easier for fans and clubs,” Mahira urged. He added: “We would have loved to train there but the transport issues make us train further at Ihura.”
