Raymond said Moi’s death has become a Military affair and thus going on, any communication will be relayed by the government’s spokesman or senior state officer. "It has been almost three months since Mzee was hospitalised at the Nairobi hospital. We had dedicated healthcare team that was taking care of both local and international cadre but our creator had decided otherwise beyond our expectations,” he said. “We want to thank the military and state operatives for swiftly moving in and it is our prayer that God will give us strength at this moment”. Earlier, DP William Ruto said the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua will take over all the burial plans. Ruto while addressing Journalists at his Harambee House Annex said Kinyua will be in charge going forward. The Deputy President said Kenya will never forget his discipline and dedication to serve the country. “Just as Moi did, we must as a country strive to excel. He taught and mentored many, his determination showed that nothing is impossible and that Kenya can be a better place,” he said. Moi died peacefully on Tuesday at 5.20 am at the Nairobi Hospital where he had been receiving treatment. President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a presidential proclamation on Tuesday announcing the passing on of the retired President.
