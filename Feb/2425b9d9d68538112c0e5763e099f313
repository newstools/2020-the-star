The former Sports CS Rashid Echesa has been arraigned at the JKIA court over fraud deals. He is facing charges over fake tender firearm deal amounting to Sh39 billion. The prosecution is seeking court orders to hold him for 21 days as it continues with investigations. Echesa's lawyer Evans Ondieki has opposed the move saying that the prosecution should have completed its findings before arresting him. The court is expected to issue its ruling at 2pm. Echesa was grilled for hours on Thursday by the DCI detectives at its headquarters in Kiambu Road. The ex-sports CS was driving towards the Nairobi Kilimani area when he was flagged by the DCI officers. It is the second time that Echesa is being arrested after he was fired by President Uhuru Kenyatta fired him from his cabinet in March 2019. Echesa was first arrested in May in connection with the killings in Matungu before being released without charges.
