Sauti Sol have officially dropped their first single under Universal Music Group, 'Suzanna'. The song tackles the controversial phenomenon of sponsors/blessers. In the song lyrics, Sauti Sol pokes fun at a woman who is a beneficiary of the champagne life as sponsored by an older man. "I see you in London/Silicone in your bum bum/Shaking what your doctor gave you... You change your skin colour/And your hair is longer now/Then I see you in Paris/ Standing next to the Champs Elysees/Looking sexy in a mini skirt," they sing cheekily. The accompanying video, directed by Leke Alabi-Isama, was shot in Nigeria. Bien said it’s more of comic relief, judging by how they are styled in the 70s disco ball chic, complete with puffy, colourful men blouses, large Afros and perms. "It’s also a reminder of the good ole days of how stylish Africans were,” he said. He adds that they have many songs that they will release this year and that they will tour around the world to promote their work. Polycarp says good vibes continue in the new album, and it will be a milestone release for the group. "Every song speaks to an issue that is relatable to everyone," he said. 'Suzanna' is the first single off their forthcoming album 'Midnight Train'.
