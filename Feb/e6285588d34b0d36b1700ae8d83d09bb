ODM leader Raila Odinga has taken a swipe at leaders who regularly make donations to churches but do not account for the source of their funds. "The thieves who steal money and look for a church every Sunday to donate to and then pretend to be doing God's work then give the money out and no one knows where the money came from... BBI will deal with those individuals," he said. Raila spoke at Maranda High School in Bondo on Thursday during celebrations to mark 100 years of its existence. Although Raila did not directly refer to any leader, Deputy President has been known to be a generous contributor to churches and has on several occasions said he will not stop giving, despite calls by some clerics to limit receiving of money from politicians. In April last year, Anglican Church Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit said the church would review donations by political leaders. Sapit spoke against using pulpits to 'clean' stolen money in the guise of charitable donations. However, Ruto said his faith comes first before 'political' titles. "Since Sunday school we learned to kneel before and worship GOD that's the ONLY reason we stand before men," he said. "We will continue to worship Jehovah with our hearts and substance." Raila on Thursday said no one chooses to be born in Kenya, but now that God placed them here, resources must be shared equally. “We can have a friendly fight during elections but that is just like twins fighting to be breastfed by their mother and that is not a fight, the real fight is on corruption,” he said. The AU envoy said with the implementation of BBI there will be no discrimination regardless of one’s background. “With the BBI, everyone will be a proud Kenyan,” Raila said. “If we tame corruption we can create jobs online by connecting all our rural areas with the internet and make it a reality to work in Japan while in Bondo or anywhere in Kenya."
