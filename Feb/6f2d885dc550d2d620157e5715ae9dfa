Fifty former Kericho civic leaders are morning former President Daniel Moi. Led by long-serving councillor Alhaji  Kiptanui, they said Kenyans should hold their horses on the Building Bridges Initiative until Moi is buried. "Let's guard against plunging this nation into chaos and anarchy over supremacy and control of BBI,” Kiptanui told journalists on Tuesday. He was a strong supporter of the Nyaya philosophy of peace, love and unity. Speaking in Kericho town,the civic leaders described Moi's leadership as exemplary. Kiptanui is deputy national chairman of the Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers. He told rival Kielewke and Tangatangagroups to put their campaigning on hold until Moil is laid to rest. Kiptanui, a former Kanu organising secretary for Kericho and Bomet, warned against taking Kenyans back to the days of tribalism and party feuds. (Edited by V. Graham)
