Police in Naivasha have impounded illicit liquor worth thousands of shillings  being ferried from Uganda into the country. During a dramatic chase along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, two suspects were arrested. Police warned members of the public to be wary of foreign liquor which could be unsafe. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the alcohol had the potential of causing blindness among consumers. He said their investigations showed the liquor was ferried by unscrupulous traders who sold it to unsuspecting members of the public. “We have managed to arrest two suspects who were ferrying the illegal brew and we are going for their bosses,” he said. Addressing the press at Naivasha police station, Waweru warned members of the public to be wary of such brews as they had not been tested. “We have in the past lost lives and others have been left blind after consuming such liquor and people should be keen on what they are drinking,” he said. While thanking his officers for a job well done, the senior officer said that they had heightened patrols along major roads passing through the town. “We have come to learn that some of the trailers ferrying goods from neighbouring countries are illegally bringing in the illicit brews and we are keenly monitoring their movement,” he said. Meanwhile, residents of Oiti village in Mai Mahiu woke up to a rude shock to find the body of an elderly man outside one of the homesteads. The man who did not have any identification documents had a small bag that only had a sheet and a t-shirt when his body the discovered.
