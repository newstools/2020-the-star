Sixty farmers' groups in Mandera have benefited from a Sh42 million grant from the World Bank to increase productivity and earnings. Of that amount, Sh30 million will go to 30 community interest groups and another 30 vulnerable and maginalised groups in six wards. The remaining Sh12 million will go towards supporting extension services. The money would be used to add value to tomatoes, honey, goats and camel meat. The grant is part of the five-year Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Project, whose objective is to increase productivity and build resilience to climate change risks in the targeted smallholder farming and pastoral communities in Kenya. The smart agriculture project is being undertaken in 24 counties, among them Mandera. The Mandera county government has also injected an additional Sh29 million to ensure the success of the project. Governor Ali Roba while issuing cheques to farmers in Mandera town on Sunday said his administration is committed to improving climate resilience to increase agricultural production. “I also want to encourage all our farmers to continue planting and nurturing tree species that can survive in our environment,” he said. The region mostly relies on irrigation water from River Daua that flows along the common border with Ethiopia. Meanwhile, over one million livestock in the county will be vaccinated against the Rift Valley Fever. “We target to vaccinate our animals against Rift Valley fever, goat plague which manifests itself through diarrhoea and pneumonia. We also want to vaccinate sheep and cattle against black quarter targeting 10,000 households in the seven subcounties of Mandera county,” Roba said.
