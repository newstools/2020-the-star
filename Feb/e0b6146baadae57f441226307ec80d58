One of the 14 pupils who died during the stampede at Kakamega Primary School was buried at their home in Molo subcounty in Nakuru County. Simon Waweru Kuria, 10, had only been at the school for only one term when the tragedy happened. He had just joined the school in the third term of 2019 when his parents were transferred to Kakamega from Eldoret. The boy who was born on May 5, 2010, was yet to fully get accustomed to the school then tragedy happened. "We were optimistic that our son would have a good stay at the school little did we know that he would not be there for four months before he met his death," said his distraught father, Francis Kuria Waweru during the burial. He narrated how his jovial son was prepared for school by his mother, Evelyn Njeri adding that everything went on smoothly until in the evening when the stampede occurred leaving him and 13 others dead and several others injured. Different speakers at funeral asked the government to ensure safety in schools with most of them saying that cases of deaths in schools were on the increase. A local leader, Kibira Muchai observed that the region was yet to come over the loss of five pupils who were struck dead by lightning at Mkulima Primary School in Kuresoi North. He said the residents also buried another child, a form three student at Bahati PCEA who died in a dorm fire last month. The girl was buried in Matuiku area of Elburgon in Molo. "It is very unfortunate that we gather here yet again to bury a child who died in school yet the soil on the other five graves is not yet dry," said Muchai.
