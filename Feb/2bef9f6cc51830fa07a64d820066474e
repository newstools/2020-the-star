Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations are currently camped at Deputy President William Ruto's office. Sources say the detectives who have been at the Ruto's Harambee House Annex, are interrogating staff and reviewing CCTV footage in the wake of the Sh39.5 billion fake military tender that has been linked to his office. The move comes after Ruto on Sunday admitted that Echesa and his alleged victims indeed visited his office but only for 23 minutes. Ruto appeared to turn the blame on other government offices and suggested the scammers could have also visited the Ministry of Defence. Echesa was arrested shortly after leaving Rutoâ€™s office and spent the weekend in police custody. The court will this afternoon expected to rule on whether Echesa will take a plea in the billion-shilling scandal. Echesa was presented before the court on Monday morning but his lawyers opposed the plea taking arguing that there is an order at JKIA court. Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot said the matters are weighty and need to make a ruling on the matter at noon. The DP came under a barrage of attacks over claims his office is at the heart of a fake Sh39 billion military deal. A section of political leaders began agitating for Ruto to step aside, claiming that his office had become a citadel of graft, in what is likely to trigger more political fireworks. Police also are investigating claims that agents of the military equipment supplier Eco Advanced Technologies had previously been hosted by Echesa at the DP's office.
