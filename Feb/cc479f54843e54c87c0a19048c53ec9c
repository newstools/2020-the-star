Kenya Hockey Union will this weekend commence the process of arbitration of transfer cases amid the uncertainty over the future of some players. The two-week process ends on March 8.  Wazalendo's Kennedy Munialo is yet to be granted his wish of playing for Butali after informing the club of his desire to embrace a new challenge. The utility player has been with the club for six years and his case is among those that will be looked into ahead of the league that starts on February 29.  The rule states that the union will arbitrate in cases where a player differs with the mother club over transfer issues. Deputy match and fixture secretary, Moses Majiwa, said the union will first listen to cases from the lower tier before settling Premier League disputes. "Arbitration starts this weekend till March 8. The super and national Leagues have more teams informing our decision to handle them first and this will be based on the first-come-first-served basis. There's anxiety at every level but we will make a free and fair decision to suit all parties," he said. He said players will not play in the league until they are cleared by the union.
