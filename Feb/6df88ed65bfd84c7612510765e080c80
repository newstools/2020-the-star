Parliament Road, Uhuru Highway are some of the roads set to be closed for motorists on Saturday ahead of President Daniel Moi's body viewing. The roads around Nyayo Stadium will also have controlled traffic while Harambee Avenue will also be a no-go zone. The public is invited to view the body within the precincts of Parliament. The burial steering committee member and Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said there is no official invite. After President Uhuru Kenyatta views the body at 10:15am on Saturday, Kenyans will be given an opportunity to pay their last respects. "We are satisfied with the preparations both at Nyayo, Parliament and at Kabarak,'" Kibicho said. Top government officials have been supervising the ongoing preparations to spruce up the Nyayo National Stadium ahead of the retired president's send-off. Kibicho said the public will be allowed to view the body from 8am to 5pm until Monday. The holding ground will be near Comesa grounds. Kibicho said they had to split the funeral committee into two due to tight timelines. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and head of Public Service  Joseph Kinyua are  in Kabarak.
