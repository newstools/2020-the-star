Ten days before they leave for Dakar, Senegal for the African boxing Olympic qualifiers, the Kenya national boxing team ‘Hit Squad’ have embarked on the final leg of their training schedule at the high altitude training camp in Nanyuki, according to coach David Munuhe. According to Munuhe,the team of 13 male and six female pugilists have adjusted seamlessly to the change in altitude after shifting their camp from Nairobi’s Police Depot in Mathare. “All the boxers are okay and no one has sustained any injury so far. They have adjusted accordingly to the change in weather and are in fact upbeat during and after training. The morale is high and everything is going on well,” revealed Munuhe. The Hit Squad  has shifted their training pattern as they head towards conclusion of the camp with Munuhe disclosing that the coaches were focusing on individual traits. “We are now working on the individual strengths of every boxer. The general tactics and techniques that they will deploy are also being polished. We are confident that when they leave for Senegal, they will be in good shape,” he said. The fighters will travel to Dakar on February 17  with the qualifiers set to kick off three days later.
