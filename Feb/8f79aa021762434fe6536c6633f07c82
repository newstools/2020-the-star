 Supreme Court judge Isaac Lenaola has been elected president of the International Association of Refugee and Migration Judges. High Court judge John Mativo was also elected a member of the association’s Supervisory Council. “Congratulations to Justices Lenaola and Mativo and we wish them well in the discharge of their duties at IARM,” the Judiciary said in a statement on Saturday. Lenaola, 52, was on Thursday elected unopposed during the polls conducted at the conclusion of the association’s Annual Conference in San Josè, Costa Rica. Formed in 1997 in Warsaw, Poland, the association brings together appellate judges and adjudicators in the interpretation and application of the 1951 Refugee Convention. It is committed to fostering recognition that protection from persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion is an individual right established under international law. The association also requires that the determination of refugee status and its cessation should be subject to the rule of law. This year’s theme of the conference was A New World on the Move: The Realities of Irregular - Mass Migration and the Challenges Facing Asylum and Immigration Judges. IARMJ has its headquarters in Harlem, The Netherlands, and has robust chapters in Europe, Africa, The Americas and Asia Pacific.
