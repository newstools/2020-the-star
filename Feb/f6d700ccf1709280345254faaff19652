Besieged Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has suffered another blow after the court declined to release his passport. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Thursday ruled that giving him back his passport will be like reviewing his own orders. "The release of the passport is tantamount to review my own orders which procedurally may lead to abuse office which the court is not ready to do,‚Äù the court ruled. Sonko had applied for the release of his passport to travel to Dubai on official duty. However, Ogoti said Sonko didn't attach a clearance as required by government officials who are traveling. Sonko had wanted to travel to Dubai to attend the 10th session of the World Urban Forum which takes place from February 8-13. Ogoti further ruled that the letters of recommendation that were relied upon by the governor did not show whether he was traveling on official duty. The court also noted that he did not attach clearance, which is a requirement for all government officials travelling out of the country. Sonko had said the conference had been convened by UN Habitat, adding that it is a high level, open and inclusive platform for addressing the challenges of sustainable urbanisation. However, the prosecution objected to the application, saying they require time to verify the documents attached in his application and the validity of his letter of invitation. The court had been told that the governor had paid for the trip using his bank cards, which the prosecution argued was proof that he was travelling for personal luxury as opposed to official duty.
