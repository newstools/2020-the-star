Comedian Njugush has advised young comedians to use social media as the most available platform to grow. Njugush has built a remarkable career for himself through social media which he uses as a platform to publish his content. Speaking to Word Is he said that the comedy industry headed in the right path and there is a big opportunity for people to grow. "Young comedians should remain consistent and don't wait for anyone to give you a platform to share your content. I used social media and that is how I have grown since it was the most available platform for me," he said. Recently, Njugush pulled a huge crowd of over two thousand people in a comedy event he held during Valentine's Day featuring his wife Celestine. "I didn't expect to have a big crowd. At first, we were targeting five hundred people but ended up adjusting," he said. He says that his greatest lesson is that having people behind you is always very important. "We are humbled that a lot of people believe in our dreams even when we don't. Consistency is the key because you can not get a huge audience in a single day," he said. Njugush was voted the 2019 Most Influential Young Kenyan in the 3rd annual ranking poll of influential young Kenyans organised by PR & Rating firm, Avance Media. The ranking of 100 young extraordinary young Kenyans, which also features 56 females, makes Njugush the 3rd winner of the prestigious title after Daniel ‘Churchill’ Ndambuki (2016) and Dr Darshan Chandaria (2018).
