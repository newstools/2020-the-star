A police officer attached to Harambee Annex who was on duty when  the Sh39 billion fake military arms deal was being signed has been found dead. Sergeant Kenei's body was on Thursday found with a bullet wound in his head at his house in  Imara Daima's Villa Franca estate. The body has been taken to City Mortuary. The officer, who was expected to record a statement, had not been seen for two days. A source had told the Star that the officer, who was scheduled to appear before DCI over the case, had not done so. Deputy President William Ruto had written to IG Hillary Mutyambai to speed up investigations into the role of former Sports CS Rashid Echesa in his involvement in the arms deal. Echesa was charged with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud. He was also charged alongside three others with six counts of making a false document in the multibillion-shilling scam. In a letter seen by the Star on Wednesday, Ruto asked the police to establish who accessed his office and how the police officers cleared them. On Tuesday, Echesa claimed that he was friends with Ruto, adding that he could see him without an appointment. "Ruto is my friend and I don't need an appointment to see him," he said. Ruto's office on Tuesday said Echesa did not access his private office, but rather the waiting room.
