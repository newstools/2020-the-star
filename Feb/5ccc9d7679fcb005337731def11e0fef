A lawmaker was forced by his colleagues to withdraw remarks that some MPs were afraid of putting to task Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to keep themselves safe from DCI sleuths. According to Chepalungu MP Gideon Koske, a number of MPs with skeletons in their closets were going slow on the police chief, negating the oversight role the powerful committee is supposed to conduct on government departments. The comments caused uproar from his colleagues, who demanded that he stops bringing disrespect to the honourable members. Mutyambai alongside Interior PS Karanja Kibicho were appearing before Public Accounts Committee to respond to audit queries. Whether Koske was right or not only the Hansard can tell. MPs were overheard grumbling that their respective government ministry has been hoodwinking them with cheap trips abroad with no tangible trinkets. The lawmakers are upset with a fast-talking Principal Secretary for organising fictitious meetings with compromised per diems and strict timelines. The lawmakers vowed to slash the budget for the ministry in the ongoing budgetary review process to teach the PS a lesson for taking them for a ride. Originality is something that anyone, especially in a top leadership position, should embrace to give voters unique services. But one lawmaker from Northeastern seems to have thrown this to the dogs. The man rarely contributes  new ideas or fresh proposals to solve any outstanding issue. Many a time, the first-term lawmaker, with a penchant for talking for minutes, finds himself ‘echoing others’ sentiments. His colleagues were overheard saying how predictable it has become whenever he takes to the floor during a debate or during committee meetings. They say that he only gets attention since some of his explanations are comical.
