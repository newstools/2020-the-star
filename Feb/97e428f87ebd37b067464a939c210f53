DCI detectives have seized 6,400 litres of ethanol along Narok-Mai Mahiu Road. The sleuths seized the ethanol on Wednesday evening. They were packed in 32 drums of 200 Litres each and camouflaged with sacks of cassava. DCI boss George Kinoti noted on Twitter that the suspects transporting the consignment were intercepted by detectives but they decided to flee. "They engaged the DCI sleuths in a wild car chase to an unestablished destination after which they abandoned their  Mitsubishi lorry and ran," Kinoti said on Thursday. "Upon being flagged down for inspection the lorry driver and another occupant jumped from the moving vehicle and escaped but are being sought." Kinoti sad the  KBQ 509P Mitsubishi lorry is under police custody as a multi agency team of DCI and Kenya Revenue Authority launch a thorough probe into the case. In December last year, KRA in collaboration with the DCI seized a consignment of 7,500 litres of ethanol with an approximate tax value of over Sh2 million. The ethanol concealed in a water tanker was intercepted at Sultan Hamud, Makueni County. Upon examination, the tanker was found to be carrying 2,500 litres of water in an outer compartment while the second concealed compartment was discovered containing 7,500 litres of ethanol.
