Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria have once again missed seats during a BBI rally. On Friday, they arrived at Kinoru Stadium in Meru for the BBI meeting, but there were no seats left for the two in the main dias. The two were seen standing behind the podium. Meru Senator Mithika Linturi was also standing. This is the second time Murkomen and Kuria are missing seats at a BBI rally. During the BBI rally in Kitui on February 1, there was chaos after Murkomen and Kuria missed their seats at the main dais. Kuria was almost being kicked out of the Kitui meeting. The two leaders appeared to engage in a scuffle with the organisers that led to several interruptions of Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana's speech. It took the effort of Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu to try and appeal for calm but the chaos persisted at the back of the dais.
