JAM, a Homa Bay-based non-governmental organisation, will spend Sh3 million annually on school fees for orphans and needy students in the county. The allocation is for learners in secondary, technical institutions, MTCs, teachers training colleges and universities. JAM director Kennedy Okoth said their main agenda is to educate the less fortunate students in the society from Form One to the highest level possible. “We usually sponsor orphans and other students whose parents are unable to cater for their school fees from Form One up to Form Four. But we don’t stop at that – we extend the support to those who proceed to tertiary institutions including universities,” he said. Okoth spoke on Tuesday during the distribution of Sh1 million cheques to students in different institutions. Cheques have also been dispatched to other students in national, extra and county schools, he said. The official said they were committed to supporting the government's policy of 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. JAM chairperson Margaret Ojwando said they have a holiday mentorship programme through which they encourage the vulnerable children to pursue their dreams. “We have a mentorship programme which we hold during holidays to encourage and give moral support to the pupils,” she said. JAM supported a total of 200 class eight pupils last year. "We will support them until they finish Form Four. We want them to transform their families and the entire society,” Ojwando said. One of the beneficiaries is Jacquelyn Atieno who the organisation pulled out of a bar in Oyugis where she was working as a waiter. Atieno is now a second-year student social work and community development student at a Kisumu institution. JAM has paid for her education since she was in Form One.
