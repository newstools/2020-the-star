A man was charged at a Nairobi court with robbery with violence after he allegedly robbed a cop of his pistol in Kayole. David Maina Munga allegedly robbed constable Howard Kipkoech–attached to Obama police post–a Jericho pistol loaded with 15 rounds of ammunition last year on August 14. His accomplice John Njoroge had earlier been arrested and freed on Sh1 million bail after he was traced to Nakuru county. It was reported that Kipkoech and his two colleagues were on night patrol when they stopped a suspicious motorbike rider. He jumped off the motorcycle and fled on foot. The three agreed that Kipkoech would ride the motorcycle to the police post as they followed behind in a Toyota Probox. Kipkoech reported that on his way to the police post, he was ambushed by a man who jumped onto the pillion seat as he negotiated a bump. On reaching a second bump, another youth accosted him and ordered him to stop before pushing him as he tried to speed away. In the commotion, his pistol fell and one of the accused people picked it before they disappeared. Maina denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji. He was freed on a surety bond of Sh 500,000. Hearing starts on June 4. Edited by R.Wamochie
