On Friday it was announced that Kenya's first suspected case of the new coronavirus had tested negative. The release of the results coincided with coronavirus being declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China. The viral outbreak has so far killed more than 200 people in China and spread to 18 countries. Subsequently, Kenya Airways has suspended all flights to and from China until further notice. Kenya Airways, which operates three flights weekly to Guangzhou via Bangkok, joins other airlines around the world that have stopped flying to the worldâ€™s second-largest economy. The government says it has put in place a strong surveillance system at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, manned by at least 22 health specialists. While these efforts are commendable, the government needs to rapidly expand the surveillance system. Many passengers fly from China to Kenya daily via Ethiopia. In essence, therefore, banning the direct flight by KQ to and from China is not enough. The country has multiple entry points, not just JKIA. Though so far no country in Africa has an active case of the virus, after a suspected case in Ivory Coast also turned out negative, nothing should be left to chance. More resources must be urgently set aside and disbursed to the Health ministry specifically for surveillance and immediate response if need be. The government must embark on a campaign to enlighten the public on the virus; preventive measures and remedial steps should a positive case be identified.
