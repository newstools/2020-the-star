The government plans to destroy 172 imported vehicles which are yet to be collected by their buyers from the customs warehouse keeper in Kilindini, Mombasa. They include Toyota Corollas, Prados, Land Rovers, Range Rovers. Mercedes Benz, and lorries. They belong to individuals and companies. This decision is saddening. The taxman has barely achieved its target in revenue collection among so many other evils facing the country such as the locust invasion, famine and drought, floods and schools with poor infrastructure; all requiring monetary attention. For the government to decide to destroy vehicles which can be sold in Kenya, Uganda and Southern Sudan is a reckless decision. These vehicles can be donated to universities to help mechanical students in research. Let Kenya employ personnel who will bring in their expertise but not poverty in Kenya. The issue of destroying the vehicles is null. Alternatively, let vehicles suitable for the Kenyan market be auctioned. ln China children are taught how to assemble vehicles when they are young and look where the country is in terms of development. Let organisations employ people who are knowledgeable with the Big Four Agenda, Vision 2030 and sustainable development goals so as to drive Kenya ahead.  Mombasa
