The Uasin Gishu county assembly has urged the executive to regulate the use of septic tanks in Eldoret town. The assembly said the department of environment and water should address the release of raw sewage from estates that poses health and environmental risks. Contributing during a motion moved by Ng’enyilel MCA David Sing’oei, nominated MCA Samora Machel said most new estates in the outskirts of Eldoret town had resorted to use of septic tanks due to lack of access to sewer lines. Septic tanks can be effective in handling small amounts of wastewater but they may pollute water supplies and the environment if they are located in sensitive areas or they are poorly built, the MCA said. Once polluted, the water becomes unsafe for drinking and toxic to the environment. Improper use of septic tanks and the immense pressure to handle large volumes of wastewater leads to overflows that end up on roads and in streams. Eldoret town and its environs has witnessed a sharp increase in population due to new businesses and many learning institutions. This has led to a rapid increase in new estates to cater for the increasing population. Many of the new estates lack sewerage connectivity. Machel said owners of the buildings make huge profits from rent but discharge harmful waste to playgrounds, exposing residents to diseases like cholera. Sewerage connectivity in Eldoret currently stands at 30 per cent. Last year, Eldoret Water and Sanitation Company manager Lawrence Sum announced the African Development Bank (AFDB) would fund the expansion of sewerage connectivity in the town at a cost of Sh.400 million to increase connectivity to 60 per cent. The assembly approved the motion asking the county government to address the raw sewage problem. Deputy speaker Hosea Korir gave the department concerned one month to respond to the concerns.
