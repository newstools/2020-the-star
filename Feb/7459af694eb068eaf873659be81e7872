ODM party leader Raila Odinga has asked Nairobi MCAs not to append their signatures on governor Mike Sonko's impeachment. In a letter seen by The Star on Wednesday, the party's chairman George Aladwa, said members should neither vote nor sign any proposal until they are further advised to. "I have been directed by party leader to advice Honorable Members that the party is not supporting the move," he said. Aladwa said there have been allegations that ODM party members are in support of Sonko's impeachment. At the moment , Sonko is having a meeting at Upper-hill with over 50 Jubilee MCAs. However, it is not clear why the ODM position was not communicated to the MCAs through the Secretary General Edwin Sifuna who is the official spokesman of the party. Shortly after the letter surfaced, Sifuna wrote a contradicting statement to the media saying the party cannot impose any directive on its members. "We wish to make it clear that the Party and the Party Leader do not and will not interfere with the power granted directly by the people to Members of the County Assembly in exercise of any of their functions including over-sighting the executive," he said. In December last year, High Court gave an okay to Nairobi MCAs to impeach the embattled governor after it declined to stop his removal from office. Sonko's troubles started with a dramatic arrest on December 6. Since then, the city has been on "autopilot" when the flashy county chief was arraigned and subsequently locked out from office over the loss of Sh357 million. He was charged and later released on Sh15 million bail. The Star established that the ward representatives have resolved to remove the beleaguered governor to "salvage the sinking county" after weeks of meetings and consultations.
