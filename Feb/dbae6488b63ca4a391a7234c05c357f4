  Police in Nyando, Kisumu county, have launched investigations into what transpired at Nyamware beach where a man hacked another to death before he was lynched by the public. Bandari Odeny, 35, was lynched by irate members of the public after he hacked Joseph Orao, 37, to death outside West Gate Bar. The crowd later set the bar on fire. Nyando police boss Leonard Matete said normality had returned even as investigations continue. He said Odeny and Orao were drinking at Westgate Bar when a scuffle ensued between them. Eyewitnesses said the two entered the bar together but started fighting a few minutes later. Odeny hacked his friend with a machete several times and Orao died on the spot. "Following the killing of Orao, locals in retaliation killed Odeny before setting the bar on fire," Matete said on the scene. “The two are known to be always involved in shady deals and we believe one might have crossed the line of the other leading to the fight,” a resident said. Matete said police were informed of the incident by a member of the public. "Officers arrived at the scene and found a rowdy crowd that engaged them in running battles. They had to use teargas to disperse them." The fire burned the bar, three hotels and one nearby shop. "We are still looking for the owner of the bar, to know what exactly transpired," Matete said. He condemned members of the public for lynching the Odeny. “Such cases should be reported and the culprits arrested. At least we could have gotten the clue as to what transpired between the two,” the police boss said. James Ouko, the owner of the shop that was burnt, said he was away in Kisumu to but more stock when the incident happened. The bodies were taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital Mortuary in Kisumu.  edited by peter obuya
