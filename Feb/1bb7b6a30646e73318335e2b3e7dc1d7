Since when did Deputy president William Ruto become a police officer? These were the words of Ruto's personal aide David Mugonyi who was responding to Narok Senator Ledama Olekina allegations on Tuesday. Shortly after he was released from police custody, Olekina accused the DP of being behind his arrest. "This today was kicks of a dying horse. This is a witchhunt. The DP is behind it. Enough is enough!" Olekina said. But in a phone interview with the Star, Mugonyi denied the claims saying that those were baseless accusations. "The last time I checked, when did Ruto become a police officer or an investigative officer? There is this primitive obsession with Ruto!" he said. Olekina said the DP is capable of negative discourse adding that he is stepping on others opinion. "His pursuit of personal interests has become a danger to us. He has created a following of ethically-minded individuals," he said. The senator said he will not be intimidated adding that he will not shy away from discussing the BBI. Olekina was arrested in Nairobi on Tuesday morning over utterances made at the JKL show last week.
