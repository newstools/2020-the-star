Christians in Kenya have joined the world in marking the first day of Lent on Ash Wednesday. Globally, the day is characterized by Church services and symbolic placing of ashes on the heads of believers. The day is marked by Catholics,  Anglicans, Methodists, and Presbyterians to mark the beginning of the 40 days of Lent. In this year's calendar, Lent season will begin today, February 26 and ends April 9. Easter Sunday will be on April 12. Christians consider Ash Wednesday a holy day of prayer and fasting. According to Wikipedia, the name Ash Wednesday derives from the placing of repentance ashes on the foreheads of participants to either the words "Repent, and believe in the Gospel" or the dictum "Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return." In the Christian calendar, it is preceded by Shrove Tuesday and falls on the first day of the six weeks of penitence before Easter. Ash Wednesday is traditionally observed by Western Christians. Lent is a solemn religious observance in the Christian liturgical calendar that ends approximately six weeks on Holy Thursday, the memorial of the Lord's supper the Thursday of Holy Week before Easter Sunday. On all these marked days, the preserved practices have deeply embedded importance to the Catholics.
