Learning in two primary schools in Naivasha were disrupted after two minors were run over and killed by vehicles in two different incidents. In the first incident, a four-year-old girl from Valley Lily Academy was crushed to death by the institution's bus seconds after she was dropped near her home. She was pronounced dead on arrival at Naivasha subcounty hospital where she had been rushed for treatment following the accident near Kayole estate along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the bus from Valley Lily Academy had been towed to area police station for inspection. He said the driver of the bus would be arraigned once investigations into the case were done. “The minor was rushed to Naivasha subcounty hospital following the accident but was unfortunately pronounced dead on arrival,” he said. Witness Joel Kimani said the driver of the bus was reversing the vehicle near the estate when it ran over the minor. Kimani said that the minor had been dropped by the bus and rushed to the back as the driver reversed. “The teacher assisted the minor to alight from the bus but unfortunately the minor went to the back of the bus and was seriously injured after being run over,” he said. In the second accident, a seven-year-old girl was hit and killed by a speeding motorist along the Naivasha-Kirima road while on her way to school. Her elder brother escaped with minor injuries during the early morning incident near Karati. Police launched a manhunt for the driver of the car who fled from the scene. Resident Jamlek Mwangi said that the two cildren were crossing the road on their way to school when the accident occurred.
