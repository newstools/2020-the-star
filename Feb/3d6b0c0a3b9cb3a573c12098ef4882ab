Donned in red caps with portraits of the late, retired President Daniel Moi, Kenyans trooped to Nyayo Stadium early Tuesday morning to bid him farewell in a memorial service. The red caps had some of Mzee Moi's popular quotes, including 'Mkae kwa amani' (stay in peace). Young and old, female to male, Kenyans remained seated eagerly waiting for the memorial service to start. Mzee Moi's body has been driven in a military truck from State House, through Processional Way, to Uhuru Highway with military officers marching in a procession. Meanwhile, Kenyans from far and wide waited. Some wrapped themselves in Maasai shukas after arriving early morning. A group of women from the Masaai community were covered in blue shukas and put on beaded necklaces around their necks. Another group of women were dressed in white and wrapped their hair in scarves. A group of women from Nyakach said they had to travel to honour the late President who championed education in the region. Choirs entertained attendees as they waited for the service to begin.
