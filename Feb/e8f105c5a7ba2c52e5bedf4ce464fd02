Sudan's rulers are to hand over ex-President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court. The former president faces charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, over the conflict that broke out in the country's Darfur region in 2003. He was ousted as president in April 2019. He came to power in a military coup in 1989 and ruled the country with an iron fist.
