 Students at the Kisii University's campus in Migori town have been locked out of the institution's premises over unpaid rent. The landlord locked the building on Monday demanding that his rent arrears be cleared. “We have been locked out of the institution since Monday. We found two padlocks on the door locking out students from lecture halls and administration offices,” Ronald Otieno, the student leader told reporters. Otieno said most students had gone back to their homes given they come from nearby villages and estates. Philip Kisiagro, a student and a local chief said the university should buy land in the town and build a campus. Otieno and Kisiagro said their institution was closed over rent arrears. Owners of the Zaodon Furniture which owns the building declined to reveal the amount of rent owed. Principal Mong’are Omari, the institution principal refused to comment on the matter and hanged up his phone.  edited by peter obuya
