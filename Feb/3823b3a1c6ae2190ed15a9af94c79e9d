The drama between Bahati and Peter Blessing seems not to be ending any time soon. In his YouTube channel, Bahati talked ill about Blessing’s mum, saying he knew the story was choreographed after Peter Blessing’ mum talked to Mpasho. "She said, 'Mtoto wangu wamemtumia sana.' For a woman who never knew someone in Nairobi, she was even given their number for her to call them," he said. "She said her son has helped us make millions but was only paid Sh3,000. Guys, if you have been following this you saw me give Peter Sh3,000 to use as fare." But speaking to Word Is, Peter said his mother and grandfather have cried so much because of Bahati. "At first, my mum used to think I had done something to make Bahati treat me that way, but after all these dramas, she knows the truth," he said. Peter added that Bahati at one point snatched away his phone, despite knowing he was travelling to go and visit his mum in Voi. "My mother was very concerned because she did not have a way to communicate with me," Peter said. "[Bahati] ignored her calls and her texts for five days, and so my mum let him be, and that is why I wonder when he says my mum was rude to him." Peter said he is sure the truth will one day come out. He added that at some point, Bahati even had the courtesy of ‘bragging’ about how he had scolded Peter Blessing’s mum. "Whenever I asked for cash to send to my family, he would ask me to leave my family alone," he said.
