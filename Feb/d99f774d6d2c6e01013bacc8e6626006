Recently there have been so many prophecies about the wickedness abroad in Kenya and warnings about God's impending judgment if we do not urgently repent. I do not dispute them. I pray, I repent, I stand in the gap on behalf of a sinful nation. I plead with God that in His anger, He would remember mercy. But I also wonder, could it be that, after 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, that we are now encamped on the banks of the Jordan about to cross into our land of promise? Yes, the mighty river is in flood stage. The rapids of deafening political noises, of BBI and referendums, of Kielewekeans and Tangatangaits, of hustlers and handshakers, of locusts and Coronavirus, of vice and violence, make this river too flooded for us to contemplate crossing it at this time. And so many among us are counseling that we should just turn back and continue wandering in the wilderness of our despair for another generation. But our God has already spoken, "Moses My servant is dead. Now, therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all these people, to the land which I am giving to themâ€”the children of Kenya" And these words have not been spoken to Uhuru or Raila or Kalonzo or Ruto or Mudavadi. They have been spoken to you and to me. To anyone who has agonised and wept over the hopeless despair in the land of our birth. God stands ready to part this Jordan so that we can cross into our land of promise. The only question that remains is, will we take Him at His word and watch Him make the waters of the Jordan standstill as we cross over to take the land or shall we be content to follow our politicians as they continue leading us on their long journey to nowhere?
