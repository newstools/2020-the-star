Kenyans trooped to Nyayo Stadium early Tuesday morning for the memorial service of the late and former President Daniel Moi. Some arrived as early as 2am and nearly all seats in the 30,000-capacity stadium were taken up by 8am. On Monday, government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said the body of Moi is expected at the stadium at 10am, while President Uhuru Kenyatta will arrive a few minutes before then. Mzee Moi's cortège will be escorted from Parliament Buildings through Uhuru Highway and Lang’ata Road before being taken to the stadium. At least seven heads of state are expected at the memorial service. South Sudan's Salva Kiir and Ethiopian President Sahle Work are among those who are in attendence. During Mzee Moi's burial at Kabarak on Wednesday, sodas and bread will be available for the first 30,000 mourners. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator George Natembeya on Monday said Mzee Moi was known for his generosity and sharing culture and it was only right that this be extended by offering free food. He said screens will be available at Nakuru Afraha Stadium to stream the event for those who will not be able to go to Kabaraka. Natembeya also ruled out claims that the body of the late President will be viewed at Afraha Stadium. He said public viewing will end on Monday at the Parliament Buildings. The elaborate burial ceremonies that will be rolled out in Moi's honour will mirror that of first president Jomo Kenyatta in 1978. Kenya has only accorded six individuals state burials since it's Independence in 1963.
