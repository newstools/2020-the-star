Migori county schools hit by floods are grappling with poor infrastructure and fear outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Already students in one of the schools are suffering from malaria. In Rongo subcounty on Wednesday, a classroom collapsed at Sigiria Primary School during morning classes. No student was injured. Last week all 12 latrines, for pupils and teachers at Getong’anya Primary School in Kuria West subcounty collapsed after floodwaters weakened the soil. “All toilets in the school are flooded, and we are fearing a cholera outbreak as our boreholes are also compromised,” Tabu Oyoo, St Joseph Modi Secondary school principal said. Oyoo said the girls’ dormitory was completely submerged by floods and the floors and walls were wet. The school management has been forced to transfer boys to teachers’ staff room while the girls have been relocated to the laboratory. He said most students have malaria, but government-owned dispensaries do not have malaria drugs, and they have to seek medication from private hospitals, more than 30km away. Oyoo urged the government to map out affected schools and offer special funds. County Kuppet secretary general Orwa Jasolo said on Thursday schools in Nyatike, Rongo, Uriri and Kuria West subcounties have been affected by heavy rains. No school in Migori has been shut because of floods. “The government and aid agencies have been concentrating on communities and leaving schools,” Jasolo told journalists in Migori town.
